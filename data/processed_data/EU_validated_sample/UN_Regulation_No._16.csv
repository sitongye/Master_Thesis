If the belt is equipped with a belt adjustment device for height such as defined in Paragraph-2.14.6. above, the position of the device and the means of securing it shall be the same as those of the vehicle design. In that case, when the dynamic test has been carried out for a type of vehicle it need not be repeated for other types of vehicle where each anchorage point is less than 50 mm distant from the corresponding anchorage point of the tested belt.

No forward part of the vehicle shall be present which by limiting the forward movement of the manikin excepting the foot, would reduce the load imposed on the restraint system during the test. The parts of the structure eliminated can be replaced by parts of equivalent strength provided they do not hinder the forward movement of the manikin."

The seating position in front of the tested seating position shall be adjusted to the middle position of travel and height or in the nearest locking position thereto. If the seat back of this seat is adjustable, the seat back angle should be adjusted using the 3-D H Point machine with its torso angle as close as possible to 10°.

The belt shall be firmly adjusted to the manikin. The board shall then be removed so that the entire length of its back is in contact with the seat back. A check shall be made to ensure that the mode of engagement of the two parts of the buckle entails no risk of reducing the reliability of locking.

The stopping distance of the trolley shall be 40 cm ± 5 cm. The trolley shall remain horizontal throughout deceleration. The deceleration of the trolley shall be achieved by using the apparatus described in Annex-6 to this Regulation or any other device giving equivalent results. This apparatus shall comply with the performance hereafter specified: The deceleration curve of the trolley, weighted with inert mass to produce a total mass of 455 kg ± 20 kg for safety-belts tests and 910 kg ± 40 kg for restraining systems tests where the nominal mass of the trolley and vehicle structure is 800 kg, shall remain within the hatched area of the graph in Annex-8. If necessary, the nominal mass of the trolley and attached vehicle structure can be increased by increments of 200 kg, in which case, an additional inert mass of 28 kg per increment shall be added. In no case shall the total mass of the trolley and vehicle structure and inert masses differ from the nominal value for calibration tests by more than ±40 kg. During calibration of the stopping device, the speed of the trolley shall be 50 km/h ± 1 km/h and the stopping distance shall be of 40 cm ± 2 cm."
<PARAGRAPH 7.7.4.2.>,"Acceleration test device The trolley shall be so propelled that its total velocity change V is 51 km/h km/h. The trolley shall remain horizontal during the acceleration. The acceleration of the trolley shall be achieved by using the apparatus complying with the performance hereafter specified: The acceleration curve of the trolley, weighted with inert mass, shall remain within the hatched area of the graph in Annex-8, and stay above the segment defined by the coordinates 10 g, 5 ms and 20 g, 10 ms. The start of the impact (T0) is defined, according to ISO 17 373 (2005) for a level of acceleration of 0.5 g. In no case shall the total mass of the trolley and vehicle structure and inert masses differ from the nominal value for calibration tests by more than ±40 velocity change V shall be 51 km/h km/h. Despite the fulfilment of the above requirements, the Technical Service shall use a mass of trolley (equipped with its seats), as specified in Paragraph-1. of Annex-6, greater than 380 kg."

The velocity change will be calculated by integration of the recorded trolley acceleration or deceleration. The distance to achieve the first 50 km/h km/h of the velocity change of the trolley may be calculated by double integration of the recorded trolley deceleration."
<PARAGRAPH 7.7.6.>,"After impact, the belt assembly or restraint system and its rigid parts shall be inspected visually, without opening the buckle, to determine whether there has been any failure or breakage. In the case of restraint systems it shall also be ascertained, after the test, whether the parts of the vehicle structure which are attached to the trolley have undergone any visible permanent deformation. If there is any such deformation this shall be taken into account in any calculation made in accordance with Paragraph-6.4.1.4.1. above."
<PARAGRAPH 7.7.7.>,"However, if the tests were performed at a higher speed and/or the acceleration curve have exceeded the upper level of the hatched area and the safety belt meets the requirements, the test shall be considered satisfactory."

<PARAGRAPH 7.8.2.>,"The belt assembly shall be removed from the test trolley without the buckle being opened. A load shall be applied to the buckle by direct traction via the straps tied to it so that all the straps are subjected to the force of daN. (It is understood that n is the number of straps linked to the buckle when it is in a locked position.) In the case where the buckle is connected to a rigid part, the load shall be applied at the same angle as the one formed by the buckle and the rigid end during the dynamic test. A load shall be applied at a speed of 400 ± 20 mm/min to the geometric centre of the buckle-release button along a fixed axis running parallel to the initial direction of motion of the button. During the application of the force needed to open the buckle, the buckle shall be held by a rigid support. The load quoted above shall not exceed the limit indicated in Paragraph-6.2.2.5. above. The point of contact of the test equipment shall be spherical in form with a radius of 2.5 mm ± 0.1 mm. It shall have a polished metal surface."
