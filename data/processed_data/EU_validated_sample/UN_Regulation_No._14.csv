All measurements shall be made according to ISO 6487 with CFC of 60 Hz or any equivalent method."
<PARAGRAPH 6.6.4.3.>,Tests of ISOFIX anchorages system only:
<PARAGRAPH 6.6.4.3.1.>,Forward direction force test: Horizontal longitudinal excursion (after pre-load) of point X of SFAD during application of the 8 kN 0.25 kN force shall be limited to 125 mm and permanent deformation including partial rupture or breakage of any ISOFIX low anchorage or surrounding area shall not constitute failure if the required force is sustained for the specified time.
<PARAGRAPH 6.6.4.3.2.>,Oblique direction force test: Excursion in the direction of the force (after pre-load) of point X of SFAD during application of the 5 kN 0.25 kN force shall be limited to 125 mm and permanent deformation including partial rupture or breakage of any ISOFIX low anchorage or surrounding area shall not constitute failure if the required force is sustained for the specified time.
<PARAGRAPH 6.6.4.4.>,"Test of ISOFIX anchorages systems and ISOFIX top tether anchorage: A tension pre-load of 50 N 5 N must be applied between the SFAD and the top-tether anchorage. Horizontal excursion (after pre-load) of point X during application of the 8 kN 0.25 kN force shall be limited to 125 mm and permanent deformation including partial rupture or breakage of any ISOFIX low anchorage and top tether anchorage, or surrounding area shall not constitute failure if the required force is sustained for the specified time.

<PARAGRAPH 6.6.5.>,Additional forces
<PARAGRAPH 6.6.5.1.>,"Seat inertia forces. For the installation position where the load is transferred into a vehicle seat assembly, and not directly into the vehicle structure, a test shall be carried out to ensure that the strength of the vehicle seat anchorages to the vehicle structure is sufficient. In this test, a force equal to 20 times the mass of the relevant parts of the seat assembly shall be applied horizontally and longitudinally in a forward direction to the seat or the relevant part of the seat assembly corresponding to the physical effect of the mass of the seat in question to the seat anchorages. The determination of the additional applied load or loads and the load distribution shall be made by the manufacturer and agreed by the Technical Service. At the request of the manufacturer, the additional load can be applied at the X point of SFAD during the static tests described above. If the top tether anchorage is integrated to the vehicle seat, this test shall be performed with the ISOFIX top tether strap. No breakage shall occur and excursion requirements given in the Table_2 have to be fulfilled. Note: This test does not have to be performed in case of any anchorage of the vehicle safety-belt system is integrated to the vehicle seat structure, and the vehicle seat is already tested and approved to meet the anchorage load tests required by this Regulation for adult passenger restraint."
<PARAGRAPH 7.>,Inspection during and after static tests for safety- belt anchorages
<PARAGRAPH 7.1.>,"All the anchorages shall be capable of withstanding the test prescribed in Paragraph-6.3. Paragraph-6.4. Permanent deformation, including partial rupture or breakage of any anchorage or surrounding area, shall not constitute failure if the required force is sustained for the specified time. During the test, the minimum spacings for the effective lower belt anchorages specified in Paragraph-5.4.2.5. and the requirements of Paragraph-5.4.3.6. for effective upper belt anchorages shall be respected."
<PARAGRAPH 7.1.1.>,"For vehicles of category M1 of a total permissible mass not exceeding 2.5 tonnes, if the upper safety-belt anchorage is attached to the seat structure, the effective upper safety-belt anchorage shall not be displaced during the test forward of a transverse plane passing through the R point and point C of the seat in question (see Figure_1 of Annex-3 to this Regulation) For vehicles other than mentioned above, the effective upper safety-belt anchorage shall not be displaced during the test forward of a transverse plane inclined 10° in forward direction and passing through the R point of the seat. The maximum displacement of the effective upper anchorage point shall be measured during the test. If the displacement of the effective upper anchorage point exceeds the above-mentioned limitation, the manufacturer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the technical service that there is no danger to the occupant. As an example, the test procedure according to Regulation-No._94 or a sled test with corresponding pulse may be carried out to demonstrate a sufficient survival space."
<PARAGRAPH 7.2.>,"In vehicles where such devices are used, the displacement and locking devices enabling the occupants of all seats to leave the vehicle must still be operable by hand after the tractive force was removed."
<PARAGRAPH 7.3.>,After testing any damage to the anchorages and structures supporting load during tests shall be noted.
<PARAGRAPH 7.4.>,"By derogation, the upper anchorages fitted to one or more seats of vehicles of category M3 and those of category M2 with a maximum mass exceeding 3.5 tonnes, which meet the requirements of Regulation-No._80, need not to comply with the requirements of Paragraph-7.1. concerning compliance with Paragraph-5.4.3.6."
