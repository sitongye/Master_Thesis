Para,6.,SPECIFICATIONS
Para,6.1.,General specifications
subpara,6.1.1.," The audible warning device shall emit a continuous and uniform sound; its acoustic spectrum shall not vary substantially during its operation. For warning devices supplied with alternating current, this requirement shall apply only at constant generator speed, within the range specified in paragraph 6.2.3.2."
subpara,6.1.2.," The warning device shall have acoustic characteristics (spectral distribution of the acoustic energy, sound pressure level) and mechanical characteristics such that it passes, in the order indicated, the following tests."
Para,6.2.,Measurement of the sound characteristics
subpara,6.2.1.," The warning device should, preferably, be tested in an anechoic environment. Alternatively, it may be tested in a semi-anechoic chamber or in an open space (5). In this case, precautions shall be taken to avoid reflections from the ground within the measuring area (for instance by erecting a set of absorbing screens). Compliance with the spherical divergence to a limit of 1 dB within a hemisphere of not less than 5 m radius, up to the maximum frequency to be measured, especially in the measuring direction and at the height of the apparatus and the microphone, shall be checked. The ambient noise level shall be at least 10 dB lower than the sound pressure level to be measured. The device to be tested and the microphone shall be placed at the same height. This height shall be between 1,15 and 1,25 m. The axis of maximum sensitivity of the microphone shall coincide with the direction of the maximum sound level of the device. The microphone shall be so placed that its diaphragm is at a distance of 2 ± 0,01 m from the plane of the sound outlet of the device. In the case of devices with several outlets, the distance shall be determined in relation to the plane of the nearest outlet to the microphone."
subpara,6.2.2.," The measurements of the sound pressure levels shall be made with a class 1 precision sound level metre conforming to the specifications of IEC Publication No 651, first edition (1979). All measurements shall be made using the time constant ‘F’. The measurement of the overall sound pressure level shall be made using the weighting curve A. The spectrum of the sound emitted shall be measured according to the Fourier transform of the acoustic signal. Alternatively, one-third octave filters conforming to the specifications of IEC Publication No 225, first edition (1966) may be used in this case, the sound pressure level in the mid-band frequency 2 500 Hz shall be determined by adding the quadratic means of the sound pressures in the one-third mid-band frequencies 2 000, 2 500 and 3 150 Hz. In every case, only the Fourier transform method shall be regarded as a reference method."
subpara,6.2.3.," The AWD shall be supplied with current, as appropriate, at one of the test voltages:"
subpara,6.2.3.1.," in the case of AWDs supplied with direct current, at a voltage measured at the terminal of the electric power source of 13/12 of the rated voltage."
subpara,6.2.3.2.," in the case of AWDs supplied with alternating current, the current shall be supplied by an electric generator of the type normally used with this type of AWD. The acoustic characteristics of the AWD shall be recorded for electric generator speeds corresponding to 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of the maximum speed indicated by the manufacturer of the generator for continuous operation. During this test, no other electrical load shall be imposed on the electric generator. The endurance test described in paragraph 6.3 shall be carried out at a speed indicated by the manufacturer of the equipment and selected from the above range."
subpara,6.2.4.," If a rectified current source is used for the test of an AWD supplied with direct current, the alternating component of the voltage measured at its terminals, when the warning devices are in operation, shall not be more than 0,1 volt, peak to peak."
subpara,6.2.5.," For AWDs supplied with direct current, the resistance of the connecting leads, expressed in ohms, including terminals and contacts, shall be as close as possible to (0,10/12) × rated voltage in volts."
subpara,6.2.6.," The warning device shall be mounted rigidly, by means of the equipment indicated by the manufacturer, on a support whose mass is at least ten times that of the warning device under test and not less than 30 kg. In addition, arrangements must be made to ensure that reflexions on the sides of the support and its own vibrations have no appreciable effect on the measuring results."
subpara,6.2.7.," Under the conditions set forth above, the sound pressure weighted in accordance with curve A shall not exceed the following values: (a)"
subpara,115,dB(A) for AWDs intended principally for motor cycles with a power less than or equal to 7 kW; (b)
subpara,118,"dB(A) for AWDs intended principally for vehicles of categories M and N, and motor cycles with a power greater than 7 kW."
subpara,6.2.7.1.," In addition, the sound-pressure level in the frequency band 1 800 to 3 550 Hz shall be greater than that of any component of a frequency above 3 550 Hz and in any event equal to or greater than: (a)"
subpara,95,dB(A) for AWDs intended principally for motor cycles with a power less than or equal to 7 kW; (b)
subpara,105,"dB(A) for AWDs intended principally for vehicles of categories M and N, and motor cycles with a power greater than 7 kW."
subpara,6.2.7.2., AWDs meeting the sound characteristics mentioned in (b) may be used on the vehicles mentioned in (a).
subpara,6.2.8.," The specifications indicated above shall also be met by a device subjected to the endurance test referred to in paragraph 6.3 below, with the supply voltage varying between 115 % and 95 % of its rated voltage for AWDs supplied with direct current or, for AWDs supplied with alternating current, between 50 % and 100 % of the maximum speed of the generator indicated by the manufacturer for continuous operations."
subpara,6.2.9.," The time lapse between the moment when the device is actuated and the moment when the sound reaches the minimum value prescribed in paragraph 6.2.7 above shall not exceed 0,2 seconds measured at an ambient temperature of 20 + 5 °C. This provision is applicable, inter alia, to pneumatic or electro-pneumatic warning devices."
subpara,6.2.10.," Pneumatic or electro-pneumatic warning devices shall, when operating under the power supply conditions established for the devices by the manufacturers, satisfy the same acoustic requirements as are prescribed for electrically operated audible warning devices."
subpara,6.2.11.," In the case of multiple-tone devices in which each sound-emitting unit is capable of functioning independently, the minimum values specified above shall be obtained when each of the constituent units is operated separately. The maximum value of the overall sound level shall not be exceeded when all the constituent units are operated simultaneously."
Para,6.3.,Endurance test
subpara,6.3.1.," The AWD shall be supplied with current at the rated voltage and with the connecting lead resistances specified in paragraphs 6.2.3 to 6.2.5 above, and operated respectively: —"
subpara,10,"000 times for AWDs intended principally for motor cycles with power less than or equal to 7 kW, —"
subpara,50,"000 times for AWDs intended principally for vehicles of categories M and N and motor cycles with a power greater than 7 kW, each time for 1 second followed by an interval of 4 seconds. During the test, the AWD shall be ventilated by an air current having a speed of approximately 10 m/sec."
subpara,6.3.2.," If the test is made in an anechoic chamber, the chamber shall be large enough to ensure normal dispersal of the heat released by the warning device during the test."
subpara,6.3.3., The ambient temperature in the testing room shall be between + 15° and + 30 °C.
subpara,6.3.4.," If, after the AWD has been operated for half the number of times prescribed, the sound-level characteristics are no longer the same as before the test, the AWD may be adjusted. After being operated the prescribed number times, and after further adjustment if necessary, the AWD must pass the test described in paragraph 6.2 above."
subpara,6.3.5.," For warning devices of the electro-pneumatic type, the device may be lubricated with the oil recommended by the manufacturer after every 10 000 times of operation."
Para,7.,MODIFICATION OF THE TYPE OF AUDIBLE WARNING DEVICE AND EXTENSION APPROVAL
subpara,7.1.,Any modification of the type of audible warning device shall be notified to the administrative department which granted approval to the type of audible warning device. This department may then:
subpara,7.1.1., either take the view that the modifications made are not likely to have any appreciable adverse effect;
