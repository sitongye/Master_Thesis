subpara,1.2.1.,The distance of measurement shall be such that the law of the inverse of the square of the distance is applicable;
subpara,1.2.2.,The measuring equipment shall be such that the angle subtended by the receiver from the reference centre of the light is between 10' and 1°;
subpara,1.2.3.,The intensity requirement for a particular direction of observation shall be satisfied if the required intensity is obtained in a direction deviating by not more than one quarter of a degree from the direction of observation.
subpara,1.3.,In the case where the device may be installed on the vehicle in more than one or in a field of different positions the photometric measurements shall be repeated for each position or for the extreme positions in the field of reference axis specified by the manufacturer.
subpara,2.,For reversing lamps the measuring points expressed in degrees of angle with the axis of reference and values of the minimum intensities of the light emitted.
subpara,2.1.,"The directions H = 0° and V = 0° correspond to the axis of reference. On the vehicle they are horizontal, parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and oriented in the required direction of visibility. They pass through the centre of reference. The values shown in the table give, for the various directions of measurement, the minimum intensities in cd."
subpara,2.2.,"If visual examination of a lamp appears to reveal substantial local variations of intensity, a check shall be made to ensure that no intensity measured between two of the directions of measurement referred to above is below 50 % of the lower minimum intensity of the two prescribed for these directions of measurement."
Para,3.,Photometric measurement of lamps equipped with several light sources The photometric performance shall be checked:
subpara,3.1.,"For non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other): With the light sources present in the lamp, in accordance with relevant subparagraphs of paragraph 7.1 of this Regulation."
subpara,3.2.,"For replaceable light source(s): When equipped with light source(s) at 6,75 V, 13,5 V or 28,0 V, the luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. For filament lamps the correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6,75 V, 13,5 V or 28,0 V). For LED light sources the correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6,75 V, 13,5 V or 28,0 V). The actual luminous fluxes of each filament lamp and/or LED light source used shall not deviate more than 5 % from the mean value. Alternatively and in case of filament lamps only, a standard filament lamp may be used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being added together.

subpara,2.2.2.,"In any test of conformity carried out by the manufacturer, equivalent methods may be used with the consent of the competent Type Approval Authority responsible for approval tests. The manufacturer is responsible for proving that the applied methods are equivalent to those laid down in this Regulation."
subpara,2.2.3.,The application of paragraphs 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 above requires regular calibration of test apparatus and its correlation with measurements made by a competent authority.
subpara,2.2.4.,"In all cases the reference methods shall be those of this Regulation, particularly for the purpose of administrative verification and sampling."
Para,2.3.,"Nature of sampling Samples of lamps shall be selected at random from the production of a uniform batch. A uniform batch means a set of lamps of the same type, defined according to the production methods of the manufacturer. The assessment shall in general cover series production from individual factories. However, a manufacturer may group together records concerning the same type from several factories, provided these operate under the same quality system and quality management."
Para,2.4.,Measured and recorded photometric characteristics The sampled lamp shall be subjected to photometric measurements for the minimum values at the points listed in Annex 3 and the required chromaticity coordinates.
Para,2.5.,"Criteria governing acceptability The manufacturer is responsible for carrying out a statistical study of the test results and for defining, in agreement with the competent Type Approval Authority, criteria governing the acceptability of his products in order to meet the specifications laid down for verification of conformity of products in paragraph 9.1 of this Regulation. The criteria governing the acceptability shall be such that, with a confidence level of 95 %, the minimum probability of passing a spot check in accordance with Annex 5 (first sampling) would be 0,95. ANNEX 5 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SAMPLING BY AN INSPECTOR"
Para,1.,General
subpara,1.1.,"The conformity requirements shall be considered satisfied from a mechanical and a geometric standpoint, in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation, if any, if the differences do not exceed inevitable manufacturing deviations."
subpara,1.2.,"With respect to photometric performances, the conformity of mass-produced lamps shall not be contested if, when testing photometric performances of any lamp chosen at random according to paragraph 7 of this Regulation, respectively:"
subpara,1.2.1.,No measured value deviates unfavourably by more than 20 % from the values prescribed in this Regulation.
subpara,1.2.2.,"If, in the case of a lamp equipped with a replaceable light source and if results of the test described above do not meet the requirements, tests on lamps shall be repeated using another standard light source."
subpara,1.2.3.,Lamps with apparent defects are disregarded.
subpara,1.3.,The chromaticity coordinates shall be complied when tested under conditions of paragraph 7 of this Regulation.
Para,2.,"First sampling In the first sampling four lamps are selected at random. The first sample of two is marked A, the second sample of two is marked B."
Para,2.1.,The conformity is not contested
subpara,2.1.1.,Following the sampling procedure shown in Figure 1 of this annex the conformity of mass-produced lamps shall not be contested if the deviations of the measured values of the lamps in the unfavourable directions are:
subpara,2.1.1.1.,Sample A  
subpara,2.1.1.2.,Sample B
subpara,2.1.2.,"Or, if the conditions of paragraph 1.2.2 above for sample A are fulfilled."
Para,2.2.,The conformity is contested
subpara,2.2.1.,Following the sampling procedure shown in Figure 1 of this annex the conformity of mass-produced lamps shall be contested and the manufacturer requested to make his production meet the requirements (alignment) if the deviations of the measured values of the lamps are:
subpara,2.2.1.1.,Sample A
subpara,2.2.1.2.,Sample B    
subpara,2.2.2.,"Or, if the conditions of paragraph 1.2.2 above for sample A are not fulfilled."
Para,2.3.,"Approval withdrawn Conformity shall be contested and paragraph 10 of this Regulation applied if, following the sampling procedure in Figure 1 of this annex, the deviations of the measured values of the lamps are:"
subpara,2.3.1.,Sample A
subpara,2.3.2.,Sample B      
subpara,2.3.3.,"Or, if the conditions of paragraph 1.2.2 above for samples A and B are not fulfilled."
Para,3.,"Repeated sampling In the cases of A3, B2, B3 a repeated sampling, third sample C of two lamps and fourth sample D of two lamps, selected from stock manufactured after alignment, is necessary within two months' time after the notification."
Para,3.1.,The conformity is not contested
subpara,3.1.1.,Following the sampling procedure shown in Figure 1 of this annex the conformity of mass-produced lamps shall not be contested if the deviations of the measured values of the lamps are:
subpara,3.1.1.1.,Sample C  
subpara,3.1.1.2.,Sample D  
subpara,3.1.2.,"Or, if the conditions of paragraph 1.2.2 above for sample C are fulfilled."
Para,3.2.,The conformity is contested
subpara,3.2.1.,Following the sampling procedure shown in Figure 1 of this annex the conformity of mass-produced lamps shall be contested and the manufacturer requested to make his production meet the requirements (alignment) if the deviations of the measured values of the lamps are:
subpara,3.2.1.1.,Sample D  
subpara,3.2.1.2.,"Or, if the conditions of paragraph 1.2.2 above for sample C are not fulfilled."
Para,3.3.,"Approval withdrawn Conformity shall be contested and paragraph 10 of this Regulation applied if, following the sampling procedure in Figure 1 of this annex, the deviations of the measured values of the lamps are:"
subpara,3.3.1.,Sample C
subpara,3.3.2.,Sample D  
subpara,3.3.3.,"Or, if the conditions of paragraph 1.2.2 above for samples C and D are not fulfilled."
