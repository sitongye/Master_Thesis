Scope," This Regulation applies to front fog lamps for vehicles of categories L3, L4, L5, L7, M, N, and T."
Introduction,"This Regulation applies to front fog lamps, which may incorporate lenses of glass or plastic material. It incorporates two distinct classes. The original front fog lamp, Class ""B"" since inception, has been updated to incorporate the angular coordinate system with an amendment to the values in the relevant photometric table. With this class, only light sources as specified in Regulation-No._37 are allowed. The Class ""F3"" is designed to increase photometric performance. In particular the beam width and the minimum luminous intensities below the H-H line ( Paragraph-6.4.3. of this Regulation) have been increased whilst controls on the maximum intensity in the foreground are introduced. Above the H-H line, the intensity of the veiling light is reduced to improve visibility. Additionally this class may provide adaptive beam patterns where the performance is varied according to the visibility conditions. The introduction of the Class ""F3"" provides for requirements that are amended to be similar to those of a headlamp as follows: (a) The photometric values are specified as luminous intensities using the angular coordinate system; (b) Light sources can be selected according to the provisions of Regulation-No._37 (Incandescent filament light sources) and Regulation-No._99 (gas discharge light sources). Light emitting diode (LED) modules and distributed lighting systems may also be used. The cut-off and the gradient definitions. The photometric requirements permit the use of asymmetrical beam distributions."
