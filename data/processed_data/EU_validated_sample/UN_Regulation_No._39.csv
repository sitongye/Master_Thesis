Para,5.,SPECIFICATIONS
subpara,5.1.,An onboard speedometer and odometer complying with the requirements of this Regulation shall be fitted to the vehicle to be approved.
subpara,5.2.,The display of the speedometer shall be located within the direct field of view of the driver and shall be clearly legible both day and night. The range of speeds displayed shall be sufficiently wide to include the maximum speed of this type of vehicle as stated by the manufacturer.
subpara,5.2.1.,"In the case of speedometers intended for vehicles of categories M, N, and L3, L4, L5, and L7, the graduation shall be 1, 2, 5 or 10 km/h. The numerical values of the speed shall be indicated on the display as follows: when the highest value on the display does not exceed 200 km/h, speed values shall be indicated at intervals not exceeding 20 km/h. When the maximum value on the display exceeds 200 km/h, then the speed values shall be indicated at intervals not exceeding 30 km/h. The indicated numerical speed value intervals need not be uniform. If a setting makes it possible for the driver to choose between the speed in km/h and mph (miles per hour), then the speed may be displayed only in either km/h or mph at any one time. The corresponding unit shall permanently be displayed."
subpara,5.2.2.,"In the case of vehicles of categories M, N, and L3, L4, L5, and L7 manufactured for sale in any country where imperial units are used, the speedometer shall also be marked in miles per hour (mph); the graduations shall be of 1, 2, 5 or 10 mph. The speed may be displayed either in km/h or mph at any one time provided that a setting makes it possible for the driver to choose between the speed in km/h and mph, in that case the corresponding unit shall permanently be displayed. The numerical values of the speed shall be indicated on the display at intervals not exceeding 20 mph and commencing at 10 or 20 mph. The indicated numerical speed value intervals need not be uniform."
subpara,5.2.3.,"In the case of speedometers intended for vehicles of categories L1 (mopeds), L2, and L6, the display readings shall not exceed 80 km/h. The graduation shall be 1, 2, 5 or 10 km/h and the marked numerical values of the speed indicated shall not exceed 10 km/h. The indicated numerical speed value intervals need not be uniform."
subpara,5.2.4.,"In the case of vehicles of categories L1, L2 and L6 manufactured for sale in any country where imperial units are used, the speedometer shall also be marked in mph; the graduation shall be of 1, 2, 5 or 10 mph. The numerical values of the speed shall be indicated on the display at intervals not exceeding 10 mph and starting at 10 or 20 mph. The indicated numerical speed value intervals need not be uniform.
