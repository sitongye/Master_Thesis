<PARAGRAPH 6.1.>,"Hydraulic test The tank shall be subjected to a hydraulic internal pressure test which shall be carried out on an isolated unit complete with all its accessories. The tank shall be completely filled with a non-flammable liquid (water, for example). After all communication with the outside has been cut off, the pressure shall be gradually increased, through the pipe connection through which fuel is fed to the engine, to a relative internal pressure equal to double the working pressure used and in any case to not less than an excess pressure of 30 kPa (0.3) bar, which shall be maintained for one minute. During this time the tank shell shall not crack or leak; however, it may be permanently deformed."
<PARAGRAPH 6.2.>,Overturn test
<PARAGRAPH 6.2.1.>,The tank and all its accessories shall be mounted on to a test fixture in a manner corresponding to the mode of installation on the vehicle for which the tank is intended: this also applies to systems for the compensation of the interior excess pressure.
<PARAGRAPH 6.2.2.>,The test fixture shall rotate about an axis lying parallel to the longitudinal vehicle axis.
<PARAGRAPH 6.2.3.>,The test shall be carried out with the tank filled to 90 per cent of its capacity and also 30 per cent of its capacity with a non-flammable liquid having a density and a viscosity close to those of the fuel normally used (water may be accepted).
<PARAGRAPH 6.2.4.>,"The tank shall be turned from its installed position 90° to the right. The tank shall remain in this position for at least five minutes. The tank shall then be turned 90° further in the same direction. The tank shall be held in this position, in which it is completely inverted, for at least another five minutes. The tank shall be rotated back to its normal position. Testing liquid that has not flowed back from the venting system into the tank shall be drained and replenished if necessary. The tank shall be rotated 90° in the opposite direction and left for at least five minutes in this position. The tank shall be rotated 90° further in the same direction. This completely inverted position shall be maintained for at least five minutes. Afterwards the tank shall be rotated back to its normal position. The rotation rate for each successive increment of 90° shall take place in any time interval from 1 to 3 minutes.
