The correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied."
<PARAGRAPH 10.2.>,"In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear being part of the lamp3, all measurements, photometric and colorimetric, shall be made applying at the input terminals of the lamp a voltage of 6.75 V Paragraph-13.5 V Paragraph-28.0 V respectively."
<PARAGRAPH 10.3.>,In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear not being part of the lamp the voltage declared by the manufacturer shall be applied to the input terminals of the lamp. The test laboratory shall require from the manufacturer the light source control gear needed to supply the light source and the applicable functions. The voltage to be applied to the lamp shall be noted in the communication form in Annex-1 of this Regulation.
<PARAGRAPH 10.4.>,"For any lamp except those equipped with filament lamps, the luminous intensities, measured after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation, shall comply with the minimum and maximum requirements. The luminous intensity distribution after one minute of operation can be calculated from the luminous intensity distribution after 30 minutes of operation by applying at each test point the ratio of luminous intensities measured at HV after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation."
<PARAGRAPH 10.5.>,The limits of the apparent surface in the direction of the reference axis of a light-signalling device shall be determined.
<PARAGRAPH 11.>,Heat resistance test
<PARAGRAPH 11.1.>,"The lamp shall be subjected to a one-hour test of continuous operation following a warm-up period of 20 minutes. The ambient temperature shall be 23 °C + 5 °C. The light source used shall be a light source of the category specified for the lamp, and shall be supplied with a current at a voltage such that it gives the specified average power at the corresponding test voltage. However, for lamps equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other), the test shall be made with the light sources present in the lamp, in accordance with Paragraph-10.2. of this Regulation."
<PARAGRAPH 11.2.>,"Where only the maximum power is specified, the test shall be carried out by regulating the voltage to obtain a power equal to 90 per cent of the specified power. The specified average or maximum power referred to above shall in all cases be chosen from the voltage range of 6, 12 or 24 V at which it reaches the highest value; for lamps equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other) the test conditions set in Paragraph-10.2. of this Regulation shall be applied."
<PARAGRAPH 11.3.>,"After the lamp has been stabilized at the ambient temperature, no distortion, deformation, cracking or colour modification shall be perceptible. In case of 3 For the purpose of this Regulation, ""being part of the lamp"" means to be physically included in the lamp body or to be external, separated or not, from the lamp body but supplied by the lamp manufacturer as part of the lamp system. doubt the intensity of light according to Paragraph-7. above shall be measured. At that measurement the values shall reach at least 90 per cent of the values obtained before the heat resistance test on the same device."
<PARAGRAPH 12.>,Modifications of a type of daytime running lamp and extension of approval
<PARAGRAPH 12.1.>,Every modification of the type of lamp shall be notified to the Type Approval Authorities which approved the type of lamp. The Type Approval Authority may then either:
