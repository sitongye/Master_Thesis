In the case of a category S3 or S4 stop lamp, which is intended to be mounted inside the vehicle, the colorimetric characteristics shall be verified with the worst case combination(s) of lamp and rear window(s) or sample plate(s). These requirements shall also apply within the range of variable luminous intensity produced by: (a) Rear position lamps of category R2; (b) Rear end-outline marker lamps of category RM2; (c) Stop lamps of categories S2 and S4."
