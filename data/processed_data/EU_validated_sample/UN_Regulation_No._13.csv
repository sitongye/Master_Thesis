<PARAGRAPH 5.1.1.5.>,"A failure detection signal may interrupt momentarily (< 10 ms) the demand signal in the control transmission, provided that the braking performance is thereby not reduced."
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.2.>,Functions of the braking equipment The braking equipment defined in Paragraph-2.3. of this Regulation shall fulfil the following functions:
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.2.1.>,"Service braking system The service braking system shall make it possible to control the movement of the vehicle and to halt it safely, speedily and effectively, whatever its speed and load, on any up or down gradient. It shall be possible to graduate this braking action. The driver shall be able to achieve this braking action from his driving seat without removing his hands from the steering control."
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.2.2.>,Secondary braking system The secondary braking system shall make it possible by application of the service brake control to halt the vehicle within a reasonable distance in the event of failure of the service braking system. It shall be possible to graduate this braking action. The driver shall be able to obtain this braking action from his driving seat without removing his hands from the steering control. For the purposes of these provisions it is assumed that not more than one failure of the service braking system can occur at one time.
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.2.3.>,"Parking braking system The parking braking system shall make it possible to hold the vehicle stationary on an up or down gradient even in the absence of the driver, the working parts being then held in the locked position by a purely mechanical device. The driver shall be able to achieve this braking action from his driving seat."
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.3.>,"The requirements of Annex-8 shall be applied to the safety aspects of all complex electronic vehicle control systems, including those defined in an independent regulation, which provide or form part of the control transmission of the braking function, included those which utilize the braking system(s) for automatically commanded braking or selective braking. However, vehicles equipped with systems or functions, including those defined in an independent regulation, which use the braking system as the means of achieving a higher level objective, are subject to Annex-8 only insofar as they have a direct effect on the braking system. If such systems are provided, they shall not be deactivated during type approval testing of the braking system."
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.4.>,Provisions for the periodic technical inspection of braking systems
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.4.1.>,"It shall be possible to assess the wear condition of the components of the service brake that are subject to wear e.g. friction linings and drums/discs (in the case of drums or discs, wear assessment may not necessarily be carried out at the time of periodic technical inspection). The method by which this may be realized is defined in Paragraph-5.2.11.2. of this Regulation. H/Rev.4 H/Rev.4 11"
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.4.2.>,"It shall be possible to verify, in a frequent and simple way, the correct operational status of those complex electronic systems which have control over braking. If special information is needed, this shall be made freely available."
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.4.2.1.>,"Where the operational status is indicated to the driver by warning signals, as specified in this Regulation, it shall be possible at a periodic technical inspection to confirm the correct operational status by visual observation of the warning signals following a power-on."
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.4.2.2.>,"At the time of type approval, the means implemented to protect against simple unauthorized modification of the operation to the verification means chosen by the manufacturer (e.g. warning signal) shall be confidentially outlined. Alternatively, this protection requirement is fulfilled when a secondary means of checking the correct operational status is available."
<PARAGRAPH 5.1.4.3.>,It shall be possible to generate maximum braking forces under static conditions on a rolling road or roller brake tester.
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.>,Characteristics of braking systems
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.1.>,"The set of braking systems with which a vehicle is equipped shall satisfy the requirements laid down for service, secondary and parking braking systems."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.>,"The systems providing service, secondary and parking braking may have common components so long as they fulfil the following conditions:"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.1.>,"There shall be at least two controls, independent of each other and readily accessible to the driver from his normal driving position. Every brake control shall be designed such that it returns to the fully off position when released. This requirement shall not apply to a parking brake control when it is mechanically locked in an applied position;"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.2.>,The control of the service braking system shall be independent of the control of the parking braking system;
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.3.>,The effectiveness of the linkage between the control of the service braking system and the different components of the transmission systems shall not be liable to diminish after a certain period of use;
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.4.>,"The parking braking system shall be so designed that it can be actuated when the vehicle is in motion. This requirement may be met by the actuation of the vehicle's service braking system, even partially, by means of an auxiliary control;"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.5.>,"Without prejudice to the requirements of Paragraph-5.1.2.3. of this Regulation, the service braking system and the parking braking system may use common components in their transmission(s), provided that in the event of a failure in any part of the transmission(s) the requirements for secondary braking are still ensured;"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.6.>,"In the event of breakage of any component other than the brakes (as defined in Paragraph-2.6. above) and the components referred to in Paragraph-5.2.2.10. below, or of any other failure of the service braking system (malfunction, partial or total exhaustion of an energy reserve), that part of the service braking system which is not affected by the failure, shall be able to bring the vehicle to a halt in the conditions prescribed for secondary braking;"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.7.>,"If service braking is ensured by the action of the driver's muscular energy assisted by one or more energy reserves, secondary braking shall, in the event H/Rev.4 H/Rev.4 12 of failure of that assistance, be capable of being ensured by the driver's muscular energy assisted by the energy reserves, if any, which are unaffected by the failure, the force applied to the service brake control not exceeding the prescribed maximum;"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.8.>,"If the service braking force and transmission depend exclusively on the use, controlled by the driver, of an energy reserve, there shall be at least two completely independent energy reserves, each provided with its own transmission, likewise independent; each of them may act on the brakes of only two or more wheels so selected as to be capable of ensuring by themselves the prescribed degree of secondary braking without endangering the stability of the vehicle during braking; in addition, each of the aforesaid energy reserves shall be equipped with a warning device as defined in Paragraph-5.2.14. below;"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.9.>,"If the service braking force and transmission depend exclusively on the use of an energy reserve, one energy reserve for the transmission is deemed to be sufficient, provided that the prescribed secondary braking is ensured by the action of the driver's muscular energy acting on the service brake control and the requirements of Paragraph-5.2.5. below are met;"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.2.10.>,"Certain parts, such as the pedal and its bearing, the master cylinder and its piston or pistons, the control valve, the linkage between the pedal and the master cylinder or the control valve, the brake cylinders and their pistons, and the lever-and-cam assemblies of brakes, shall not be regarded as liable to breakage if they are amply dimensioned, are readily accessible for maintenance, and exhibit safety features at least equal to those prescribed for other essential components (such as the steering linkage) of the vehicle. Any such part as aforesaid whose failure would make it impossible to brake the vehicle with a degree of effectiveness at least equal to that prescribed for secondary braking shall be made of metal or of a material with equivalent characteristics and shall not undergo notable distortion in normal operation of the braking systems."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.3.>,"The failure of a part of a hydraulic transmission system shall be signalled to the driver by a device comprising a red tell-tale signal lighting up before or upon application of a differential pressure of not more than 15.5 bar between the active and failed brake equipment, measured at the master cylinder outlet and remaining lit as long as the failure persists and the ignition (start) switch is in the ""On"" (run) position. However, a device comprising a red tell-tale signal lighting up when the fluid in the reservoir is below a certain level specified by the manufacturer is permitted. The tell-tale signal shall be visible even by daylight; the satisfactory condition of the signal shall be easily verifiable by the driver from the driver's seat. The failure of a component of the device shall not entail total loss of the braking equipment's effectiveness. Application of the parking brake shall also be indicated to the driver. The same tell-tale signal may be used."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.4.>,"Where use is made of energy other than the muscular energy of the driver, there need not be more than one source of such energy (hydraulic pump, air compressor, etc.), but the means by which the device constituting that source is driven shall be as safe as practicable."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.4.1.>,"In the event of failure in any part of the transmission of a braking system, the feed to the part not affected by the failure shall continue to be ensured if required for the purpose of halting the vehicle with the degree of H/Rev.4 H/Rev.4 13 effectiveness prescribed for secondary braking. This condition shall be met by means of devices which can easily be actuated when the vehicle is stationary, or by automatic means."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.4.2.>,"Furthermore, storage devices located down-circuit of this device shall be such that in the case of a failure in the energy supply after four full-stroke actuations of the service brake control, under the conditions prescribed in Paragraph-1.2. of Annex-4 to this Regulation, it is still possible to halt the vehicle at the fifth application, with the degree of effectiveness prescribed for secondary braking."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.4.3.>,"However, for hydraulic braking systems with stored energy, these provisions can be considered to be met provided that the requirements of Paragraph-1.3. of Annex-4 to this Regulation, are satisfied."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.5.>,The requirements of Paragraph-5.2.2. Paragraph-5.2.3. Paragraph-5.2.4. above shall be met without the use of any automatic device of a kind such that its ineffectiveness might pass unnoticed through the fact that parts normally in a position of rest come into action only in the event of failure in the braking system.
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.6.>,The service braking system shall act on all wheels of the vehicle and shall distribute its action appropriately among the axles.
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.7.>,"In the case of vehicles equipped with electric regenerative braking systems of category B, the braking input from other sources of braking, may be suitably phased to allow the electric regenerative braking system alone to be applied, provided that both the following conditions are met:"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.7.1.>,"Intrinsic variations in the torque output of the electrical regenerative braking system (e.g. as a result of changes in the electric state of charge in the traction batteries) are automatically compensated by appropriate variation in the phasing relationship as long as the requirements3 of one of the following annexes to this Regulation are satisfied: Annex-3, Paragraph-1.3.2., or Annex-6, Paragraph-5.3. (including the case with the electric motor engaged), and wherever necessary, to ensure that braking rate 3/ remains related to the driver's braking demand, having regard to the available tyre/road adhesion, braking shall automatically be caused to act on all wheels of the vehicle."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.8.>,"The action of the service braking system shall be distributed between the wheels of one and the same axle symmetrically in relation to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle. Compensation and functions, such as anti-lock, which may cause deviations from this symmetrical distribution shall be declared."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.8.1.>,"Compensation by the electric control transmission for deterioration or defect within the braking system shall be indicated to the driver by means of the yellow warning signal specified in Paragraph-5.2.21.1.2. below. This requirement shall apply for all conditions of loading when compensation exceeds the following limits: 3 The Type Approval Authority, which is to grant approval, shall have the right to check the service braking system by additional vehicle test procedures. H/Rev.4 H/Rev.4 14"
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.8.1.1.>,A difference in transverse braking pressures on any axle: (a) Of 25 per cent of the higher value for vehicle decelerations 2 m/sec2; (b) A value corresponding to 25 per cent at 2 m/sec2 for decelerations below this rate.
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.8.1.2.>,An individual compensating value on any axle: (a) 50 per cent of the nominal value for vehicle decelerations 2 m/sec2; (b) A value corresponding to 50 per cent of the nominal value at 2 m/sec2 for decelerations below this rate.
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.8.2.>,"Compensation as defined above, is permitted only when the initial brake application is made at vehicle speeds greater than 10 km/h."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.9.>,Malfunctions of the electric control transmission shall not apply the brakes contrary to the driver's intentions.
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.10.>,"The service, secondary and parking braking systems shall act on braking surfaces connected to the wheels through components of adequate strength. Where braking torque for a particular axle or axles is provided by both a friction braking system and an electrical regenerative braking system of category B, disconnection of the latter source is permitted, providing that the friction braking source remains permanently connected and able to provide the compensation referred to in Paragraph-5.2.7.1. above. However, in the case of short disconnection transients, incomplete compensation is accepted, but within 1s, this compensation shall have attained at least 75 per cent of its final value. Nevertheless, in all cases, the permanently connected friction braking source shall ensure that both the service and secondary braking systems continue to operate with the prescribed degree of effectiveness. Disconnection of the braking surfaces of the parking braking system shall be permitted only on condition that the disconnection is controlled exclusively by the driver from his driving seat, by a system incapable of being brought into action by a leak."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.11.>,"Wear of the brakes shall be capable of being easily taken up by means of a system of manual or automatic adjustment. In addition, the control and the components of the transmission and of the brakes shall possess a reserve of travel and, if necessary, suitable means of compensation such that, when the brakes become heated, or the brake linings have reached a certain degree of wear, effective braking is ensured without immediate adjustment being necessary."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.11.1.>,"Wear adjustment shall be automatic for the service brakes. Automatic wear adjustment devices shall be such that after heating followed by cooling of the brakes, effective braking is still ensured. In particular the vehicle shall remain capable of normal running after the tests conducted in accordance with Annex-3, Paragraph-1.5. (Type-I test)."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.11.2.>,Checking the wear of the service brake friction components
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.11.2.1.>,"It shall be possible to easily assess this wear on service brake linings from the outside or underside of the vehicle, without the removal of the wheels, by the H/Rev.4 H/Rev.4 15 provision of appropriate inspection holes or by some other means. This may be achieved by utilizing simple standard workshop tools or common inspection equipment for vehicles. Alternatively, a sensing device per wheel (twin wheels are considered as a single wheel), which will warn the driver at his driving position when lining replacement is necessary, is acceptable. In the case of an optical warning, the yellow warning signal specified in Paragraph-5.2.21.1.2. below may be used."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.11.2.2.>,"Assessment of the wear condition of the friction surfaces of brake discs or drums may only be performed by direct measurement of the actual component or examination of any brake disc or drum wear indicators, which may necessitate some level of disassembly. Therefore, at the time of type approval, the vehicle manufacturer shall define the following: (a) The method by which wear of the friction surfaces of drums and discs may be assessed, including the level of disassembly required and the tools and process required to achieve this; (b) Information defining the maximum acceptable wear limit at the point at which replacement becomes necessary. This information shall be made freely available, e.g. vehicle handbook or electronic data record."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.12.>,"In hydraulic-transmission braking systems, the filling ports of the fluid reservoirs shall be readily accessible; in addition, the receptacles containing the reserve fluid shall be so designed and constructed that the level of the reserve fluid can be easily checked without the receptacles having to be opened, and the minimum total reservoir capacity is equivalent to the fluid displacement resulting when all the wheel cylinders or calliper pistons serviced by the reservoirs move from a new lining, fully retracted position to a fully worn, fully applied position. If these latter conditions are not fulfilled, the red warning signal specified in Paragraph-5.2.21.1.1. below shall draw the driver's attention to any fall in the level of reserve fluid liable to cause a failure of the braking system."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.13.>,The type of fluid to be used in hydraulic transmission braking systems shall be identified by the symbol in accordance with Figure_1 or 2 of Standard ISO 9128:2006 and the appropriate DOT marking (e.g. DOT 3). The symbol and the marking shall be affixed in a visible position in indelible form within 100 mm of the filling ports of the fluid reservoirs; additional information may be provided by the manufacturer.
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.14.>,Warning device
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.14.1.>,"Any vehicle fitted with a service brake actuated from an energy reservoir shall, where the prescribed secondary braking performance cannot be obtained by means of this brake without the use of the stored energy, be provided with a warning device, giving an optical or acoustic signal when the stored energy, in any part of the system, falls to a value at which without re-charging of the reservoir and irrespective of the load conditions of the vehicle, it is possible to apply the service brake control a fifth time after four full-stroke actuations and obtain the prescribed secondary braking performance (without faults in the service brake transmission device and with the brakes adjusted as closely as possible). This warning device shall be directly and permanently connected to the circuit. When the engine is running under normal operating conditions and there are no faults in the braking H/Rev.4 H/Rev.4 16 system, as is the case in type approval tests, the warning device shall give no signal except during the time required for charging the energy reservoir(s) after start-up of the engine. The red warning signal specified in Paragraph-5.2.21.1.1. below shall be used as the optical warning signal."

<PARAGRAPH 5.2.15.>,"Without prejudice to the requirements of Paragraph-5.1.2.3. above, where an auxiliary source of energy is essential to the functioning of a braking system, the reserve of energy shall be such as to ensure that, if the engine stops or in the event of a failure of the means by which the energy source is driven, the braking performance remains adequate to bring the vehicle to a halt in the prescribed conditions. In addition, if the muscular effort applied by the driver to the parking braking system is reinforced by a servo device, the actuation of parking braking shall be ensured in the event of a failure of the servo device, if necessary by using a reserve of energy independent of that normally supplying the servo device. This reserve of energy may be that intended for the service braking system."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.16.>,The pneumatic/hydraulic auxiliary equipment shall be supplied with energy in such a way that during its operation the prescribed deceleration values can be reached and that even in the event of damage to the source of energy the operation of the auxiliary equipment cannot cause the reserves of energy feeding the braking systems to fall below the level indicated in Paragraph-5.2.14. above.

H/Rev.4 H/Rev.4 18 or down gradient. Alternatively, in this case, an automatic actuation of the parking brake is allowed when the vehicle is stationary, provided that the above performance is achieved and, once applied, the parking brake remains engaged independently of the status of the ignition (start) switch. In this alternative, the parking brake shall be automatically released as soon as the driver starts to set the vehicle in motion again. The engine/manual transmission or the automatic transmission (park position) may be used to achieve or assist in achieving the above performance."

In addition, such an electrical failure in the control or break in the wiring external to the electronic control unit(s) and excluding the energy supply shall be signalled to the driver by flashing the red warning signal specified in Paragraph-5.2.21.1.1. as long as the ignition (start) switch is in the ""On"" (run) position including a period of not less than 10 seconds thereafter and the control is in the ""On"" (activated) position. However, if the parking braking system detects correct clamping of the parking brake, the flashing of the red warning signal may be suppressed and the non-flashing red signal shall be used to indicate ""parking brake applied"". Where actuation of the parking brake is normally indicated by a separate red warning signal, satisfying all the requirements of Paragraph-5.2.21.2. below, this signal shall be used to satisfy the above requirement for a red signal."
<PARAGRAPH 5.2.19.3.>,"Auxiliary equipment may be supplied with energy from the electric transmission of the parking braking system provided that the supply of energy is sufficient to allow the actuation of the parking braking system in addition to the vehicle electrical load under non-fault conditions.
