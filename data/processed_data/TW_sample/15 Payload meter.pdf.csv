15,Pay load meter
15.1,"Payload indicator: device installed on the sandstone-carrying vehicle, used to indicate the loading weight therein."
15.2,"The heavy dump semi-trailer and the heavy dump truck ( category N3 ) above 20 MT, loading gravel and sand or soil, shall be equipped with pay load meter certified under the type approval of vehicle component from 2001/7/1. The installing position, metering range and weight metering tolerance, etc., shall comply with paragraphs specified below in this regulation."
15.3,"Pay load meter shall according to suitable types and range of principlepÃ‰Except brand and type series shall be the same, and also the same theory and structure (hydraulic or electronic type)."
15.4,"Requirement of the function and specification: Shall describe installing method, payload indicating range and accuracy of reading scale."
15.5,Inspection standard of payload:
15.5.1,Load-displaying method of payload indicator:
15.5.1.1,The minimum reading scale shall be under 500 kg.
15.5.1.2,The reading scale shall be difficult to erase. Nor is under a risk of not apparent or misread (the electronic-type payload indicator is excluded).
15.5.2,"Alteration-proof design: shall have a lead-seal design or relevant one to avoid of altering the records. And shall be difficult altering the internal mechanism performed externally, to fulfill the purpose of alteration-proof."
15.5.3,"Vibration test: install the payload indicator on the vibration table under normal installing status. Using 4.5 acceleration, 33 Hz of vibrating frequency to make vibration in the up-down direction for 4 hrs, forward-backward axis direction for 2 hrs and right-left axis direction for 2 hrs. The payload indicator shall have no abnormal condition in any parts, no deformation and break thereof."
15.5.4,"Water-proof test: install the payload indicator under normal installing status, then put it in a place about 40 cm away from a water-spraying outlet. The water-spraying pipe is rotating in the angular speed of 15-25 rpm. The specimen is rotating in the angular speed of 17 rpm along the vertical axis, testing time duration is 10 minutes. The payload indicator shall have no abnormal condition in any part after the test, nor has water penetrating into the device."
15.5.5,"Dust-proof test: install the payload indicator under normal installing status, then put it in a closed container with the length, width and height within 90-120 cm. The specimen is put above"
15,"cm away the container internal wall, pouring about 5 kg of first-type Portland cement into the container, blowing into air 2-5 seconds for each"
15,"minute interval making the cement spread uniformly, and keep on  implementing this procedure for 5 hours. The payload indicator shall have no abnormal condition in any part after the test, nor has dust penetrating into the device."
