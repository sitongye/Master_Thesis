Furthermore, when the device is removed, it shall be proven, using drawings, etc., that it will not change the isolation resistance between the live parts and the electrical chassis.

With Ro installed, measure th the electrical chassis. (See Figure 3). Calculate the electrical isolation (Ri) according to the formula shown. Divide this electrical isolation value (in ohms) by the nominal operating voltage of the high voltage bus (in volts). Calculate the electrical isolation (Ri) according to the following formula: Ri = Ro*(Vb/V2 1/V2) Figure 5: "
64-1.6.2.2.3.5,"Fifth step The electrical isolation value Ri (in ohms) divided by the working voltage of the high voltage bus (in volts) results in the isolation resistance (in ohms/volt). NOTE 1: The standard known resistance Ro (in ohms) should be the value of the minimum required isolation resistance (in ohms/V) multiplied by the working voltage of the vehicle plus/minus 20 per cent (in volts). Ro is not required to be precisely this value since the equations are valid for any Ro; however, a Ro value in this range should provide good resolution for the voltage measurements."
