88.6.1.2.1.3,"Prior to the test the vehicle is prepared to allow remotely controllable hydrogen releases from the hydrogen system. The number, location and flow capacity of the release points downstream of the main hydrogen shut-off valve are defined by the vehicle manufacturer taking worst case leakage scenarios under single failure condition into account. As a minimum, the total flow of all remotely controlled releases shall be adequate to trigger demonstration of the automatic ""warning"" and hydrogen shut-off functions."
88.6.1.2.1.4,"For the purpose of the test, a hydrogen concentration detector is installed where hydrogen gas may accumulate most in the passenger compartment (e.g. near the headliner) when testing for compliance with Paragraph-. of this Regulation and hydrogen concentration detectors are installed in enclosed or semi enclosed volumes on the vehicle where hydrogen can accumulate from the simulated hydrogen releases when testing for compliance with Paragraph-. of this Regulation ( Paragraph-)."

When testing for compliance with Paragraph- of this Regulation, the simulated leak is then increased using the remote controllable function until the main hydrogen shut-off valve is closed and the tell-tale warning signal is activated. The monitoring of the electric power to the shut-off valve or of the sound of the shut-off valve activation may be used to confirm the operation of the main shut-off valve of the hydrogen supply."
88.6.1.2.2.5,"When testing for compliance with Paragraph-. of this Regulation, the test is successfully completed if the hydrogen concentration in the passenger compartment does not exceed 1.0 per cent. When testing for compliance with Paragraph-. of this Regulation, the test is successfully completed if the tell-tale warning and shut-off function are executed at (or below) the levels specified  Paragraph-. of this Regulation; otherwise, the test is failed and the system is not qualified for vehicle service."

88.6.3.2,"Hydrogen leakage is evaluated at accessible sections of the fuel lines from the high pressure section to the fuel cell stack (or the engine), using a gas leak detector or a leak detecting liquid, such as soap solution."
88.6.3.3,Hydrogen leak detection is performed primarily at joints
88.6.3.4,"When a gas leak detector is used, detection is performed by operating the leak detector for at least 10 seconds at locations as close to fuel lines as possible."
88.6.3.5,"When a leak detecting liquid is used, hydrogen gas leak detection is performed immediately after applying the liquid. In addition, visual checks are performed a few minutes after the application of liquid to check for bubbles caused by trace leaks."
