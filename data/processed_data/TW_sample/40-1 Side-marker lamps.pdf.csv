40-1.4.4,In the case of a lamp containing more than one light source: the lamp shall comply with the minimum intensity required when any one light source has failed; when all light sources are illuminated the maximum intensity specified may not be exceeded.
40-1.4.5,All light sources which are connected in series are considered to be one light source.
40-1.4.6,The angle of 10 degrees below the horizontal may be reduced to 5 degrees in case of lamps with a mounting height with its H plane less than 750 mm above the ground.
40-1.4.7,"In the case of light source modules, it shall be checked that:"
40-1.4.7.1,The design of the light source module(s) shall be such as:
40-1.4.7.1.1,that each light source module can only be fitted in no other position than the designated and correct one and can only be removed with the use of tool(s);
40-1.4.7.1.2,"If there are more than one light source module used in the housing for a device, light source modules having different characteristics can not be interchanged within the same lamp housing."
40-1.4.7.2,The light source module(s) shall be tamperproof.
40-1.4.7.3,"A light source module shall be so designed that regardless of the use of tool(s), it shall not be mechanically  interchangeable with any replaceable approved light source."
40-1.4.8,Photometric test
40-1.4.8.1,"For replaceable light sources: (a) In the case of filament lamps, that is necessary to produce the reference luminous flux required for that category of filament lamp; (b) In the case of LED light sources of 6.75 V or 13.5 V; the luminous flux value produced shall be corrected. The correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied. (c) When equipped with light sources at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, the luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. For filament lamps the correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). For LED light sources the correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). The actual luminous fluxes of each light source used shall not deviate more than +/- 5 per cent from the mean value. Alternatively and in case of filament lamps only, a standard filament lamp may be used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being added together."
40-1.5,"Trichromatic coordinate: The colour of the light emitted inside the field shall be amber defined in light- of this Directionsp·see Figure 1 and Figure 2p¸, outside this field, no sharp variation of colour shall be observed. These requirements shall apply within the range of variable luminous intensity produced by testing conditions. However, for lamps equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other), the colorimetric characteristics should be verified with the light sources present in the lamp."
40-1.6,In the case of replaceable light source(s):
40-1.6.1,"Any category or categories of light source(s) approved according to Filament lamps may be used, its shall concern about relevant special restriction. "
40-1.6.2,The design of the device shall be such that the light source(s) can be fixed in no other position but the correct one.

40-1.7.1,Measuring condition for each test:
40-1.7.1.1,"All measurements, photometric and colorimetric shall be carried out with an uncoloured or coloured standard light source of the category prescribed for the device, supplied with the voltage:"
40-1.7.1.1.1,In the case of lamps with non-replaceable light sources: 6.75 V and 13.5 V respectively.
40-1.7.1.1.2,"In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear being part of the lamp1 applying at the input terminals of the lamp the voltage declared by the manufacturer or, if not indicated, 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, respectively."
40-1.7.1.1.3,"In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear not being part of the lamp, the voltage declared by the manufacturer shall be applied to the input terminals of the lamp."
40-1.7.2,The test laboratory shall require from the manufacturer the light source control gear needed to supply the light source and the applicable functions.
40-1.7.3,The limits of the apparent surface in the direction of the reference axis of a lightsignalling device shall be determined.
