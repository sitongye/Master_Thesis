50-2.4,Test method:
50-2.4.1,The Height of the head restraint
50-2.4.1.1,"All lines (including the projections of reference line) shall be drawn in the plane of symmetry of the seat considered, the intersection of which plane with the seat determines the contour of the head restraint and of the seat-back. (Indicated in Fig 1.)"
50-2.4.1.2,"The manikin corresponding to a fiftieth percentile adult male or the manikin shall be placed in a normal position on the seat. The seat back, if inclinable, shall be locked in a position corresponding to a rearward inclination of the reference line of the manikin's torso of as nearly as possible 25 degrees from the vertical or the angle declared by the manufacturer. "
50-2.4.1.3,The projection of the reference line of the manikin shall in the case of the seat considered be drawn in the plane specified  Paragraph- above. The tangent S to the top of the head restraint shall be drawn perpendicular to the reference line.
50-2.4.1.4,The distance h from R point to the tangent S is defined as the height of head restraint.
50-2.4.2,The width of the head restraint (indicated in Fig 2)

Alternatively, these components may be considered satisfactory if they pass the energy-dissipation test. If the above-mentioned parts of the head restraints and their supports are covered with material softer than 50 Shore (A) hardness, the requirements of this paragraph, with the exception of those relating to energy-dissipation, shall apply only to the rigid parts."
50-2.5.3,"The head restraint shall be anchored to the seat or, where appropriate, to the vehicle structure, in such a way that no rigid and dangerous part projects from the padding of the head restraint, from the anchorage or from the seat back as a result of the pressure exerted by the head during the test."
