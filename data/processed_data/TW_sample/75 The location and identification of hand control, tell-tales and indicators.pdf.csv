The tell-tale which alerts front seat occupants that the passenger air bag is switched off must be visible to the driver and a front passenger(s) under all driving conditions"
75.4.2,Identification
75.4.2.1,"Where fitted, the controls, tell-tales and indicators, listed under the Table 1, shall be identified by symbols designated for them in Table 1. This requirement does not apply to the horn (an audible warning signal) control, when it is activated by a narrow ring-type control or by a lanyard. If a symbol is used for identifying a control, tell-tale or indicator not listed in Table 1, it is recommended to use a symbol designated for the purpose in standard ISO 2575:2004 where one exists and where that symbol is suitable for the application concerned. "
75.4.2.2,"To identify a control, a tell-tale or an indicator not included in Table 1 or ISO 2575:2004,the manufacturer may use a symbol of its own conception. Such symbol may include internationally recognized alphabetic or numeric indications. All symbols used shall follow the design principles laid down in paragraph 4. of ISO 2575:2004."
75.4.2.3,"If necessary for clarity, supplementary symbols may be used in conjunction with any symbol specified in Table 1 or ISO 2575:2004."
75.4.2.4,Each additional or supplementary symbol used by the manufacturer must not cause confusion with any symbol specified in this Regulation.
75.4.2.5,"Where a control, an indicator or a tell-tale for the same function are combined, one symbol may be used to identify such combination."
75.4.2.6,"Except as provided  Paragraph-., all identifications of tell-tales, indicators and controls listed in Table 1 or ISO 2575:2004 must appear to the driver perceptually upright. In case of rotating control, this paragraph applies to it when such control is in its ""off"" position."
75.4.2.7,The identification of the following need not appear to the driver perceptually upright:
75.4.2.7.1,"A horn control Paragraph- Any control, tell-tale or indicator located on the steering wheel, when the steering wheel is positioned for the motor vehicle to travel in other than a straight forward direction, Paragraph- Any rotating control that does not have an off position."
75.4.2.8,Each control for the automatic vehicle speed system (cruise control) and each control for heating and air conditioning system(s) shall have identification provided for each function of each such system.
75.4.2.9,"When fitted each control that regulates a system function over a continuous range shall have identification provided for the  limits of the adjustment range of any such function. If colour coding is used to identify the limits of the adjustment range of a temperature function, the hot limit shall be identified by the colour red and the cold limit by the colour blue. If the status or limit of a function is shown by an indicator separated from and not adjacent to the control for that function, both the control and the indicator must be independently identified in compliance with Paragraph-."
75.4.3,Illumination
75.4.3.1,"The identifications of controls for which the word ""Yes"" is indicated in column 4 of Table 1 shall be capable of being illuminated whenever the position lamps are activated. This does not apply to controls located on the floor, floor console, steering wheel, or steering column, or in the area of windscreen header, or to controls for a heating and air-conditioning system if the system does not direct air directly upon the windscreen."
