27.11.1.2.2,Step 2: Place the object at a defined distance from the camera. Measure the width of the object displayed on the monitor (b) in a situation without real sun light condition e.g. with a measurement microscope.
27.11.1.2.3,Step 3: Calculate the residual object width (alpha) according to the following equation:  where: alpha: residual width of the object displayed on the monitor (with smear) (minutes of arc) b: width of the object displayed on the monitor (without smear) (mm) s: width of the smear (mm) r: viewing distance (mm)
27.11.1.3,Case B: Smear does not appear
27.11.1.3.1,Step 1: Place the object at a defined distance from the camera. Measure the width of the object displayed on the monitor (b) in a situation without real sun light condition e.g. with a measurement microscope.
27.11.1.3.2,Step 2: Calculate the object width (alpha) according to the following where: alpha: width of the object displayed on the monitor (without smear) (minutes of arc) b: width of the object displayed on the monitor (without smear) (mm) r: viewing distance (mm)
27.11.1.4,Data supplied by the instructions for usepÉIn case of Class V and VI camera monitor devices the instructions for use shall include a table that shows the minimum and maximum mounting height of the camera above ground under consideration of different viewing distances. The camera must be mounted within the applicable height range. The viewing distances shall be selected from the intended context of usep·table 1p¸.  Table 1: Data supplied by the instructions for use
27.11.1.4.1,The value of the minimum mounting height is the same for all viewing distances as it is independent of the viewing distance. It is determined by the dimensions of the field of vision and the field of view of the camera. Use the following working steps for determination of the minimum mounting height.
27.11.1.4.1.1,Step 1: Draw the intended field of vision on ground.
27.11.1.4.1.2,Step 2: Place the camera above the field of vision in such a way that the camera is viewing the field of vision. The lateral position shall be in accordance with the intended mounting position at the vehicle.
27.11.1.4.1.3,"Step 3: Change the height of the camera above ground in such a way, that the field of vision displayed on the monitor covers an area at least as large as the field of vision. Furthermore, the field of vision display should encompass the entire monitor screen."
27.11.1.4.1.4,Step 4: Measure the height between camera and ground which is the minimum mounting height. Report the result value.
27.11.1.4.2,The value of the maximum mounting height is different for different viewing distances as the displayed object size varies with the mounting height. Use the following working steps for determination of the maximum mounting height:
27.11.1.4.2.1,Step 1: Determine the minimum width bmin of the critical object displayed on the monitor for each viewing distance.  where: r: viewing distance in mm bmin: minimum width of the critical object displayed on the monitor in mm
27.11.1.4.2.2,Step 2: Place the critical object inside the drawn intended field of vision in a position at which the distance between the critical object and the camera is largest. The illumination conditions shall be in such a way that the critical object is clearly visible on the monitor.
27.11.1.4.2.3,Step 3: Select the first value of the possible viewing distances.
27.11.1.4.2.4,"Step 4: Change the height of the camera above ground in such a way, that the residual width B of the object displayed on the monitor is equal to the minimum width allocated to that viewing distance. B=bmin where: B: residual width of the object displayed on the monitor (which is ""b"" in cases without smear and ""b - s"" in cases with smear) in mm (see paragraph 1.1. General)"
27.11.1.4.2.5,Step 5: Measure the height between camera and ground which is the maximum mounting height allocated to that viewing distance. Report the result value.
27.11.1.4.2.6,Step 6: Repeat the aforementioned steps 4 and 5 for the other viewing distances.
