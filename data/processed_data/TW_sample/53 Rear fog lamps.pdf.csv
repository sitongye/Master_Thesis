53.5,Heat resistance test
53.5.1,Test Measures
53.5.1.1,"The lamp must be subjected to a one-hour test of continuous operation following a warm-up period of 20 minutes. The ambient temperature shall be 23 degrees C +/- 5 degrees C. The lamp used shall be a lamp of the category prescribed for the lamp, and shall be supplied with a current at a voltage such that it gives the specified average power at the corresponding test voltage."
53.5.1.2,"Where only the maximum power is specified, the test shall be carried out by regulating the voltage to obtain a power equal to 90 per cent of the specified power."
53.5.1.3,"In the case of light sources operated by an electronic control gear to obtain variable luminous intensity, the test shall be carried out under the conditions given over 90 percent of the higher luminous intensity."
53.5.2,"Test standard  After the lamp has been stabilized at the ambient temperature, no distortion, deformation, cracking or colour modification shall be perceptible."
53.6,"Color CoordinatepÉThe colour of the light, which shall be measured under conditions described  Paragraph-. 7 The colorimetric characteristics of the light in the distribution range in Fig. 1 shall be red defined in ng and light- of Directions. Outside this field no sharp variation of colour shall be observed. This requirement also applies to range of variable light of category F2 rear fog lamps. For the lamps with non-replaceable light sourcep·filament lamp or other p¸, the measurement shall be carried out with fitted light source"
53.7,Test conditions for each measuring
53.7.1,"All measurements, photometric and colorimetric, on lamps equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and others) shall be made at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, respectively."
53.7.2,"In case of a lamp with replaceable light source, if not supplied by an electronic light source control gear or a variable intensity control, with an uncolored or colored standard light source of the category prescribed for the device, supplied with the voltage (a) In the case of filament lamp(s), that is necessary to produce the reference luminous flux required for that category of filament lamp, (b) In the case of LED light sources of 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V; the luminous flux value produced shall be corrected. The correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied. (c) When equipped with light source(s) at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, the luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. For filament lamps the correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). When equipped with LED light source(s) at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0  V; the luminous flux value produced shall be corrected. The correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied. The actual luminous fluxes of each light source used shall not deviate more than +/- 5 per cent from the mean value. Alternatively and in case of filament lamps only, a standard filament lamp may be used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being added together."

53.7.4,"In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear or a variable intensity control, not being part of the lamp the voltage declared by the manufacturer shall be applied to the input terminals of the lamp."
53.7.5,The technical service shall require from the manufacturer the light source control gear or a variable intensity control needed to supply the light source and the applicable functions.

53.7.7,"For any lamp except those equipped with filament lamps, the luminous intensities, measured after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation, shall comply with the minimum and maximum requirements. The luminous intensity distribution after one minute of operation can be calculated from the luminous intensity distribution after 30 minutes of operation by applying at each test point the ratio of luminous intensities measured at HV after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation."
53.7.8,The limits of the apparent surface in the direction of the reference axis of a light- signalling device shall be determined.  Figure 1
