23-2.10.1,"The smallest discernable detail of class V and VI camera-monitor devices. The smallest discernable detail of the naked eye shall be defined according to standard ophthalmologic tests like the Landolt C test or the Triangle Orientation Discrimination (TOD) test. The smallest discernable detail at the centre of the viewing system can be determined using the Landolt C test or the TOD test. In the rest of the viewing area, the smallest discernable detail may be estimated from the centrally determined smallest discernable detail and the local image deformation. For instance, in the case of a digital camera the smallest discernable detail at a given pixel location (in the monitor) scales inversely with the solid angle of the pixel."
23-2.10.1.1,"Landolt-C testIn the Landolt-C test, test symbols are judged by the subject under test. In accordance with this test the  smallest discernable detail is defined as the visual angle of the gap size of the Landolt C symbol at threshold size and is expressed in arcmin. The threshold size corresponds to the size at which the subject judges the orientation correctly in 75 percent of the trials. The smallest discernable detail is determined in a test involving a human observer. A test chart containing test symbols is placed in front of the camera and the observer judges the orientation of test symbols from the monitor. From the threshold gap size of the Landolt C test symbol d (m) and the distance between the test pattern and the camera D (m) the smallest discernable detail omega c (arcmin) is calculated as follows:"
23-2.10.1.2,"TOD testThe Landolt C test can be used to determine the smallest discernable detail of the camera-monitor system. However, for sensor systems it is more suitable to use the TOD (Triangle Orientation Discrimination) method which is similar to the Landolt C method, but involves equilateral triangular test patterns. The Triangle Orientation Discrimination method is described in detail by Bijl & Valeton (1999), who provide practical guidelines on how to perform a TOD measurement. In the method, triangular test patterns (see Figure 1) are viewed through the viewing system under test. Each triangle can have one out of four possible orientations (apex up, left, right or down) and the observer indicates/guesses for each triangle its orientation. When this procedure is repeated for many (randomly oriented) triangles of different sizes the fraction of correct responses can be plotted (see Figure 2), and increases with test pattern size. The threshold is defined as the point at which the fraction correct crosses the 0.75 level and can be obtained by fitting a smooth function through the data (see Bijl & Valeton, 1999). Critical perception is reached when the critical object diameter equals two times the width of the triangle at threshold size. The smallest discernable detail (c) is equal to 0.25 times the width of the triangle at threshold size. This means that, from the threshold triangle width w (in meter) and the distance between test pattern and the camera D (in m) the smallest discernable detail c (in arcmin) is calculated as follows: "
23-2.10.2,"Determination of the critical viewing distance of the monitor. For a monitor having certain dimensions and properties, the distance to the monitor can be calculated within which the detection distance is dependent only on the performances of the camera. The critical viewing distance rmcrit is defined as the distance at which the smallest discernable detail displayed on the monitor spans 1 arc min measured from the eye (the acuity threshold of a standard observer). where: rmcrit : critical viewing distance of the monitor (m) : size of the smallest discernable detail on the monitor (m)"

23-2.10.3.2,"For detection distance greater than the critical viewing distance. Where, due to the installation, the distance eye-monitor is more than the critical viewing distance, the maximum obtainable detection distance is defined as: where: rdfar: detection distance for distances larger than the critical viewing distance (m) rdclose: detection distance for distances smaller than the critical viewing distance (m) rm: viewing distance, i.e. distance between eye and monitor (m) rmcrit: critical viewing distance (m)"

It shall also be verified the degree to which the glare correction will be addressed and the angle at which sunlight can strike a monitor and these shall be compared to the corresponding measuring results from the system measurements. This can be either based on a CAD-generated model, a determination of the angles of light for the device when mounted on the relevant vehicle, or by carrying out relevant measurements on the relevant vehicle as described in paragraph 23-1.10.2.2 of this Direction.
