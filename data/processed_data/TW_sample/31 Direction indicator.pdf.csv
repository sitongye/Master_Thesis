31.5.2.2.7.3,"The filament lamp holder shall conform to the characteristics given in IEC Publication 60061. The holder data sheet relevant to the category of filament lamp used, applies."
31.5.2.3,"For direction indicator lamps of categories 11, 11a, 11b, 11c or 12 the flash may be produced by sequential activation of their light sources if the following conditions are met: (a) Each light source, after its activation, shall remain lit until the end of the ON cycle; (b) The sequence of activation of the light sources shall proceed in a uniform progressive manner from inboard towards the outboard edge of the apparent surface; (c) It shall be one continuous line without repeat alternation in the vertical direction (e.g. no waves); (d) The variation shall finish no more than 200 ms after the beginning of the ON cycle; (e) For the orthogonal projection in the direction of the axis of reference of a rectangle, circumscribing the apparent surface of the direction indicator shall have its longer sides parallel to the H-plane, the ratio of the horizontal to the vertical sides shall not be less than 1.7. Compliance with the conditions mentioned above shall be verified in flashing mode."
