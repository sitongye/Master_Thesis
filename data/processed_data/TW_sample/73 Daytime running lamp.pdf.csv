73.8.4,"For any lamp except those equipped with filament lamps, the luminous intensities, measured after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation, shall comply with the minimum and maximum requirements. The luminous intensity distribution after one minute of operation can be calculated from the luminous intensity distribution after 30 minutes of operation by applying at each test point the ratio of luminous intensities measured at HV after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation."

The light source used shall be a light source of the category specified for the daytime running lamp, and shall be supplied with a current at a voltage such that it gives the specified average power at the corresponding test voltage. However, for daytime running lamps equipped with nonreplaceable light sources (filament lamps and other), the test shall be made with the light sources present in the daytime running lamp, in accordance with Paragraph- of this Regulation."
73.9.2,"Where only the maximum power is specified, the test shall be carried out by regulating the voltage to obtain a power equal to 90 per cent of the specified power. The specified average or maximum power referred to above shall in all cases be chosen from the voltage range of 6, 12 or 24 V at which it reaches the highest value; for daytime running lamps equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other) the test conditions set  Paragraph- of this Regulation shall be applied."
73.9.3,"After the daytime running lamp has been stabilized at the ambient temperature, no distortion, deformation, cracking or colour modification shall be perceptible. In case of doubt the intensity of light according  Paragraph- above shall be measured.

73.10.4.2,"For replaceable light sources: When equipped with filament lamps at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, the luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. For filament lamps the correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). The actual luminous fluxes of each filament lamp used shall not deviate more than +/-5 percent from the mean value. Alternatively a standard filament lamp may be used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated*/ .At its reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being added together."
73.10.4.3,"For any daytime running lamp except those equipped with filament lamp(s), the luminous intensities, measured after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation, shall comply with the minimum and maximum requirements.
