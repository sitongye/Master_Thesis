19-1.6.3.1.1,Five samples shall undergo the test in the case of an isotropic material or ten samples in the case of a non-isotropic material (five for each direction).
19-1.6.3.1.2,"The samples shall be taken from the material under test. In materials having different burning rates in different material directions, each direction has to be tested. The samples are to be taken and placed in the test apparatus so that the highest burning rate will be measured. When the material is supplied in widths, a length of at least 500 mm shall be cut covering the entire width. From this the samples shall be taken so as to be at least 100 mm from the material edge and equidistant from each other. Samples shall be taken in the same way from finished products, when the shape of the product permits. When the thickness of the product is more than 13 mm, it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side  which does not face the respective compartment (interior, engine or separate heating compartment). If it is impossible, the test shall be carried out, in accordance with the Technical Service, on the initial thickness of the material, which shall be mentioned in the test report. Composite materials shall be tested as if they were of uniform construction. In the case of materials made of superimposed layers of different composition which are not composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the respective compartment shall be tested individually."
19-1.6.3.1.3,"A sample is held horizontally in a U-shaped holder and is exposed to the action of a defined flame for 15 seconds in a combustion chamber, the flame acting on the free end of the sample. The test determines if and when the flame extinguishes or the time in which the flame passes a measured distance."
19-1.6.3.1.4,The pins serve as the measuring points at the beginning and end of the burning distance (see figure 2).  Figure 2: Example of sample holder
19-1.6.3.2,Samples
19-1.6.3.2.1,Shape and dimensions
19-1.6.3.2.1.1,"The shape and dimensions of samples are given in Figure 3. The thickness of the sample corresponds to the thickness of the product to be tested. It shall not be more than 13 mm. When taking the sample permits, the sample shall have a constant section over its entire length. (Dimensions in millimeters)  Figure 3: Sample"
19-1.6.3.2.1.2,"If the shape and dimensions of a product do not permit taking a sample of the given size, the following minimum dimensions shall be maintained: (a) For samples having a width of 3 to 60 mm, the length shall be 356 mm. In this case the material is tested in the product's width; (b) For samples having a width of 60 to 100 mm, the length shall be at least 138 mm. In this case the potential burning distance corresponds to the length of the sample, the measurement starting at the first measuring point."
19-1.6.3.2.2,Conditioning (Dimensions in millimeters)  The samples shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours but not more than 7 days at a temperature of 23 deg. C +/- 2 deg. C and a relative humidity of 50 +/- 5 per cent and shall be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior to testing.
19-1.6.3.3,Procedure
19-1.6.3.3.1,Place samples with napped or tufted surfaces on a flat surface and comb twice against the nap using the comb.
19-1.6.3.3.2,Place the sample in the sample holder so that the exposed side will be downwards to the flame.
19-1.6.3.3.3,"Adjust the gas flame to a height of 38 mm using the mark in the chamber, the air intake of the burner being closed. Before starting the first test, the flame shall burn at least for 1 min for stabilization."
19-1.6.3.3.4,"Push the sample-holder into the combustion chamber so that the end of the sample is exposed to the flame, and after 15 seconds cut off the gas flow."
19-1.6.3.3.5,The measurement of the burning time starts at the moment when the foot of the flame passes the first measuring point. Observe the flame propagation on the side burning faster than the other (upper or lower side).
19-1.6.3.3.6,"Measurement of burning time is completed when the flame has come to the last measuring point or when the flame extinguishes before coming to the last measuring point. If the flame does not reach the last measuring point, measure the burnt distance up to the point where the flame extinguished. Burnt distance is the decomposed part of the sample, which is destroyed on its surface or in the interior by burning. "
19-1.6.3.3.7,"In so far as the sample does not ignite or does not continue burning after the burner has been extinguished, or when the flame extinguishes before reaching the first measuring point, so that no burning time is measured note in the test report that the burning rate is 0 mm/min."
19-1.6.3.3.8,"When running a series of tests or repeat tests, ensure that the combustion chamber and sample holder have a maximum temperature of 30 deg. C before starting the next test."
19-1.6.3.4,"Calculation The burning rate, B1, in millimeters per minute, is given by the formula: B = 60 s/t where: s = the burnt distance, in millimeters; t = the time, in seconds, to burn distance s. 1 The burning rate (B) for each sample is only calculated in the case where the flame reaches the last measuring point or the end of the sample."
19-1.6.4,Test to determine the melting behaviour of materials 
19-1.6.4.1,Sampling and principle
19-1.6.4.1.1,"Four samples, for both faces (if they are not identical) shall undergo the test."
19-1.6.4.1.2,A sample is placed in a horizontal position and is exposed to an electric radiator. A receptacle is positioned under the specimen to collect the resultant drops. Some cotton wool is put in this receptacle in order to verify if any drop is flaming.
19-1.6.4.2,"Samples The test samples shall measure: 70 mm x 70 mm. Samples shall be taken in the same way from finished products, when the shape of the product permits. When the thickness of the product is more than 13 mm, it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side which does not face the respective compartment (interior, engine or separate heating compartment). If it is impossible, the test shall be carried out, in accordance with the Technical Service, on the initial width of the material which shall be mentioned in the test report. Composite materials shall be tested as if they were of uniform construction. In the case of materials made of superimposed layers of different composition which are not composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the respective passenger compartment (interior, engine or separate heating compartment) shall be tested individually. The total mass of the sample to be tested shall be at least 2 g. If the mass of one sample is less, a sufficient number of samples  shall be added. If the two faces of the material differ, both faces must be tested, which means that eight samples are to be tested. The samples and the cotton wool shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours at a temperature 23 deg. C +/- 2 deg. C and a relative humidity of 50 +/- 5 per cent and shall be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior to testing."
19-1.6.4.3,"Procedure The sample is placed on the support and the latter is so positioned that the distance between the surface of the radiator and the upper side of the sample is 30 mm. The receptacle, including the cotton wool, is placed beneath the grill of the support at a distance of 300 mm. The radiator is put aside, so that it cannot radiate on the sample, and switched on. When it is on full capacity it is positioned above the sample and timing is started. If the material melts or deforms, the height of the radiator is modified to maintain the distance of 30 mm. If the material ignites, the radiator is put aside three seconds afterwards. It is brought back in position when the flame has extinguished and the same procedure is repeated as frequently as necessary during the first five minutes of the test. After the fifth minute of the test: (i) If the sample has extinguished (whether or not it has ignited during the first five minutes of the test) leave the radiator in  position even if the sample reignites; (ii) If the material is flaming, await extinction before bringing the radiator into position again. In either case, the test shall be continued for an additional five minutes."
19-1.6.4.4,"Results Observed phenomena shall be noted in the test-report, such as: (i) The fall of drops, if any, whether flaming or not; (ii) If ignition of the cotton wool has taken place."
19-1.6.5,Test to determine the vertical burning rate of materials
19-1.6.5.1,Sampling and principle
19-1.6.5.1.1,"Three samples shall undergo the test in the case of an isotropic material, or six samples in the case of a non-isotropic material."
19-1.6.5.1.2,"This test consists of exposing samples, held in a vertical position, to a flame and determining the speed of propagation of the flame over the material to be tested."
19-1.6.5.2,Samples
19-1.6.5.2.1,"The samples dimensions are: 560 x 170 mm.  If the dimensions of a material do not permit taking a sample of the given dimensions the test shall be carried out, in accordance with the Technical Service, on the fitted size of the material which shall be mentioned in the test report."
19-1.6.5.2.2,"When the thickness of the sample is more than 13 mm, it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side which does not face the respective compartment (interior, engine or separate heating compartment). If it is impossible, the test shall be carried out in accordance with the Technical Service the initial thickness of the material, which shall be mentioned in the test report. Composite materials shall be tested as if they were of uniform construction. In the case of materials made of superimposed layers of different composition which are not composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the respective compartment shall be tested individually."
19-1.6.5.2.3,The samples shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours at a temperature of 23 deg. C +/- 2 deg. C and a relative humidity of 50 +/- 5 per cent and shall be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior to testing.

The frame shall be fitted on the support so that the specimen is vertical."
19-1.6.5.3.4,"The marker threads shall be attached horizontally in front of and behind the specimen at the locations shown in Figure 4. At each location, a loop of thread shall be mounted so that the two segments are spaced 1 mm and 5 mm from the front and rear face of the specimen. Each loop shall be attached to a suitable timing device. Sufficient tension shall be imposed to the threads to maintain their position relative to the specimen.  (Dimensions in millimetres)  Figure 4: Burner ignition location"
19-1.6.5.3.5,"The flame shall be applied to the specimen for 5 seconds. Ignition shall be deemed to have occurred if flaming of the specimen continues for 5 seconds after removal of the igniting flame. If ignition does not occur, the flame shall be applied for 15 seconds to another conditioned specimen."
19-1.6.5.3.6,"If any result in any set of three specimens exceeds the minimum result by 50 per cent, another set of three specimens shall be tested for that direction or face. If one or two specimens in any set of three specimens fail to burn to the top marker thread, another set of three specimens shall be tested for that direction or face."
19-1.6.5.3.7,"The following times, in seconds, shall be measured: (a) From the start of the application of the igniting flame to the severance of one of the first marker threads (t1); (b) From the start of the application of the igniting flame to the severance of one the second marker threads (t2); (c) From the start of the application of the igniting flame to the severance of one the third marker threads (t3)."
19-1.6.5.3.8,"If the sample does not ignite or does not continue burning after the burner has been extinguished or if the flame extinguishes before the destruction of one of the first marker threads occurred, so that no burning time is measured, the burning rate is considered to be 0 mm/min."
19-1.6.5.3.9,"If the sample does ignite and the flames of the burning sample do reach the height of the third marker threads without  destroying the first and second marker threads (e.g. due to material characteristics of thin material sample), the burning rate is considered to be more than 100 mm/min."
19-1.6.5.4,"Results The observed phenomena shall be written down in the test-report, to include: (a) The durations of combustion: t1, t2 and t3 in seconds, and (b) The corresponding burnt distances: d1, d2 and d3 in mm. The burning rate V1 and the rates V2 and V3, if applicable, shall be calculated (for each sample if the flame reaches at least one of the first marker threads) as follows: Vi = 60 di/ti (mm/min) The highest burning rate of V1, V2 and V3 shall be taken into account."
