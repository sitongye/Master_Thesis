48-2.7.6.4.6.1,"Seat inertia forces. For the installation position where the load is transferred into a vehicle seat assembly, and not directly into the vehicle structure, a test shall be carried out to ensure that the strength of the vehicle seat anchorages to the vehicle structure is sufficient. In this test, a force equal to 20 times the mass of the relevant parts of the seat assembly shall be applied horizontally and longitudinally in a forward direction to the seat or the relevant part of the seat assembly corresponding to the physical effect of the mass of the seat in question to the seat anchorages. The determination of the additional applied load or loads and the load distribution shall be made by the manufacturer and agreed by the Technical Service. At the request of the manufacturer, the additional load can be applied at the X point of SFAD during the static tests described above. If the top tether anchorage is integrated to the vehicle seat, this test shall be performed with the ISOFIX top tether strap. No breakage shall occur and excursion requirements given in the table 6 have to be fulfilled. This test does not have to be performed in case of any anchorage of the vehicle safety-belt system is integrated to the vehicle seat structure, and the vehicle seat is already tested and approved to meet the anchorage load tests required by this Regulation for adult passenger restraint."
