After cleaning the samples shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours at 23 deg. C +/- 2 deg. C and (50 +/- 5) per cent relative humidity. The initial haze value according  Paragraph- of this Regulation of the test sample is measured at 9 measurement points across the sample (see 4 in Figure 18).
25-3.20.5.2,Test equipment pre-check
25-3.20.5.2.1,Before the equipment is used for testing samples the back and forth linear motion of the pillars of the base apparatus shall be checked for being uniform without any disturbance like getting stuck or starting to vibrate.
25-3.20.5.2.2,"Build up the whole instrument including tray, wiper carriage assembly, wiper blade holders and new wiper blades but without sample box and sample (see Figure 16). To do so the two new wiper blades shall be mounted to their respective wiper blade holders and the latter ones shall be fixed to the carriage assembly. Then align using a spirit level the base plate where later the sample box will be placed and the wiper carriage assembly. Check that the distances of the two bearings of both self-supporting arms at the wiper carriage assembly and at the wiper blade holder are identical. Furthermore control visually that the wiper blade rest on the base plate uniformly without losing contact to the base plate at any point of the wiper blade."
25-3.20.5.2.3,After this pre-check the wiper carriage assemble with the wiper blade holder and the wiper blade shall be removed from the base instrument to allow built up of the sample boxes.
25-3.20.5.2.4,"The test shall be carried out under the following conditions: ambient temperature of 20 deg. C +/- 5 deg. C, atmospheric pressure of 86 kPa to 106 kPa (860 mbar to 1,060 mbar), and relative humidity of (60 +/- 20) per cent."
25-3.20.5.3,Abrasion procedure 
25-3.20.5.3.1,With the instrument described above two samples shall be tested in parallel. In case there is only one sample to be tested the second sample box needs to be fitted with a dummy sample.
25-3.20.5.3.2,The sample box shall be placed into the stainless steel tray and fixed using adhesive tape on the two short sides of the box according to see B in Figure 16. It is essential that the position of the box leads to a wiping area in exactly the middle of the sample (see 2 in Figure 16). A spacer plaque adjusted to the thickness of the test sample so that the test sample surface and the bottom surface of the sample box are on the same height (no visible gap in height between sample and bottom surface of the sample box) shall be placed into the hole in the bottom of the sample box.
25-3.20.5.3.3,The sample shall be placed with the to be tested side facing up (representing the outside surface of the plastic glazing part) into the sample holder of the sample box onto the right spacer plaque (which has a soft masking film on its surface to avoid scratching the test samples backside). An adhesive tape shall be used all around the test sample to fix it into the holder and seal the space between sample edge and sample box (to avoid suspension penetrating underneath the sample). The tape shall be used in such a way that the overlay between tape and sample is at maximum 10 mm or in other words in such a way that the wiping area of the sample (see Figure 18) is free of any adhesive tape.
25-3.20.5.3.4,"After fixing the sample the carriage assembly including wiper holders and blades from the pre-check shall be mounted to the pillars of the base apparatus. Thereby, the wiper blades get into contact with their respective samples. The correct load (15 +/- 0.5 g/cm of the wiper blade onto the sample shall be checked using a spring balance.9 Ensure again that the whole equipment (especially test sample, box, and carriage assembly inclusive wiper holder and blade) is aligned by using a spirit level."
25-3.20.5.3.5,A freshly prepared suspension shall be filled into each sample box and then the linear back and forth motion of the wiper blade shall be started. 
25-3.20.5.3.6,In order to ensure a homogenous abrading it is necessary to follow the action described below:
25-3.20.5.3.6.1,"After half of the test cycle numbers 10,000 cycles the test shall be stopped and the two sample boxes shall be exchanged without turning them (see Figure 17)10; this leads to an exchange for the two simultaneously tested samples regarding their wiper blades and furthermore alters the alignment of the self-supporting arm carrying the blade (from left to right or the other way round)."
25-3.20.5.4,Sample treatment after abrasion
25-3.20.5.4.1,"When the abrasion test is finished after 20,000 wipe cycles the suspension shall be drained and the abraded test samples shall be removed and cleaned using a multistep process including: (a) Washing with running water, (b) Drying, (c) Wiping with an iso-propanol soaked soft cloth, (d) Followed by deionized water, and (e) Drying."
25-3.20.5.4.2,After cleaning the abraded test samples shall be checked for visible chatter marks as this indicates a none uniform movement of the wiper during the abrasion test. In case of visible chatter marks this sample shall be discarded from further investigation and a retest with a new test sample needs to be done.
25-3.20.5.4.3,"The samples without chatter marks shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours at 23 deg.C +/- 2 deg. C and (50 +/- 5) per cent relative humidity. The final haze value according to this regulation of the test samples shall be measured within the middle of the samples(area of 75 mm x 60 mm).  The area at the edges of the sample - 20 mm from the long edges and 37.5 mm from the short edges - shall be excluded from the optical measurement. These areas include the reversal point of the wiper blade and the two ends of the wiper blade, where localized different abrasion conditions could exist compared to the middle of the test sample."
25-3.20.5.4.4,Nine measurement points according to Figure 18 below shall be used to determine the delta haze at these points and calculate an average delta haze afterwards.
25-3.20.6,"Expression of results Subtract the initial haze from the final haze for every measurement point, the difference representing the so-called delta haze. Calculate out of these values for the individual measurement points the average delta haze (including standard deviation) resulting from abrasion action of aqueous dirt wiped for 20,000 cycles on the sample surface by a to be reported wiper blade type."
25-3.20.7,"Design Drawing of the Wiper Blade Holder, see Figure 19 (Cross-cut view of the wiper blade holder with the support plate (left side) and the clamping plate (right side)),Design Drawing from the Sample Box ,see Figure 20 (Side view of the support plate (left side) and the clamping plate (right side)), see Figure 21(Details regarding the area A in figure 2), see Figure 22(3-D view of the wiper blade holder). see Figure 23 (Bird's-eye view of the box), see Figure 24 (Cross cut view at A), see Figure 25 (3-D view of the box)."
25-3.20.8,Interpretation of results The safety glazing shall be considered satisfactory if the increase of haze as a result of abrasion of the test piece does not exceed 2 per cent.

Water spray will be directed only against the test specimen surface facing the light source. No recirculation of the spray water or immersion of the test specimens in the water shall be permitted."
25-3.21.1.3.9,"The test specimens shall be rotated about the arc in order to provide uniform distribution of the light. All positions in the exposure apparatus shall be filled with test specimens or surrogates to ensure that a uniform temperature distribution is maintained. Test specimens shall be held in frames with backs exposed to the cabinet environment. However, reflections from cabinet walls shall not be permitted to strike the back surface of specimens. If necessary, samples may be backed to block such reflections so long as free circulation of air at the specimen surface is not impeded."
25-3.21.1.3.10,The exposure apparatus shall be operated to provide continuous light and intermittent water spray in 2 h cycles. Each 2 h cycle shall be divided into periods during which the test specimens are exposed to light without water spray for 102 minutes and to light with water spray for 18 minutes.

25-3.23,Burning behaviour (fire-resistance) test
25-3.23.1,"Purpose and scope of application This method enables the horizontal burning rate of materials used in the passenger compartment of motor vehicles (for example, private passenger cars, lorries (trucks), estate cars, motor coaches) after exposure to a small flame to be determined. This method permits testing of materials and components of a vehicle's interior equipment individually or in combination up to a thickness of 13 mm. It is used to judge the uniformity of production lots of such materials with respect to their burning behaviour. Because of the many differences between the real-world situation (application and orientation within a vehicle, conditions of use, ignition source, etc.) and the precise test conditions prescribed herein, this method cannot be considered as suitable for evaluation of all true in-vehicle burning characteristics."
25-3.23.2,Definitions
25-3.23.2.1,Burning rate: The quotient of the burnt distance measured according to this method and the time taken to burn that distance. It is expressed in millimetres per minute.
25-3.23.2.2,"Composite material: A material composed of several layers of similar or different materials intimately held together at their surfaces by cementing, bonding, cladding, welding, etc. When different materials are connected together intermittently (for example, by sewing, high-frequency-welding, riveting), then in order to permit the preparation of individual samples in accordance with paragraph 23-3 23.5. below such materials shall not be considered as composite materials."
25-3.23.2.3,Exposed side: The side which is facing towards the passenger compartment when the material is mounted in the vehicle.
25-3.23.3,"Principle  A sample is held horizontally in a U-shaped holder and is exposed to the action of a defined low-energy flame for 15 seconds in a combustion chamber, the flame acting on the free end of the sample. The test determines whether and when the flame is extinguished or the time which the flame requires to proceed over a measured distance."
25-3.23.4,Apparatus
25-3.23.4.1,"Combustion chamber (Figure 26), preferably of stainless steel, having the dimensions given in Figure 27. The front of the chamber contains a flame-resistant observation window, which may cover the entire front and which can be constructed as an access panel. The bottom of the chamber has vent holes, and the top has a vent slot all around. The combustion chamber is placed on four feet, 10 mm high. The chamber may have a hole at one end for the introduction of the sample holder containing the sample; in the opposite end, a hole is provided for the gas-supply line. Melted material is caught in a pan (see Figure 28) which is placed on the bottom of the chamber between vent holes without covering any vent hole area."
25-3.23.4.2,"Sample holder, consisting of two U-shaped metal plates or frames of corrosion-proof material. Dimensions are given in Figure 29. The lower plate is equipped with pins and the upper one with corresponding holes, in order to ensure a consistent holding of the sample. The pins also serve as measuring points at the beginning and end of the burning distance. A support shall be provided in the form of heat-resistant wires 0.25 mm in diameter spanning the frame at 25-mm intervals over the bottom U-shaped frame (see Figure 30). The plane of the lower side of samples shall be 178 mm above the floor plate. The distance of the front edge of the sample holder from the end of the chamber shall be 22 mm; the distance of the longitudinal sides of the sample holder from the sides of the chamber shall be 50 mm (all inside dimensions). (See Figures 26 and 27)."
25-3.23.4.3,Gas burner  The small ignition source is provided by a Bunsen burner having an inside diameter of 9.5 mm. It is so located in the test cabinet that the centre of its nozzle is 19 mm below the centre of the bottom edge of the open end of the sample (see Figure 27).
25-3.23.4.4,Test gas The gas supplied to the burner shall have a calorific value of about 38 MJ/m3 (for example natural gas).

25-3.23.4.6,"Stop-watch, accurate to 0.5 sec."
25-3.23.4.7,"Fume cupboard The combustion chamber may be placed in a fume-cupboard assembly provided that the latter's internal volume is at least 20 times, but not more than 110 times, greater than th volume of the combustion chamber and provided that no single height, width, or length dimension of the fume cupboard is greater than 2.5 times either of the other two dimensions. Before the test, the vertical velocity of the air through the fume cupboard shall be measured 100 mm forward of and to the rear of the ultimate site of the combustion chamber. It shall be between 0.10 and 0.30 m/s in order to avoid possible discomfort to the operator from combustion products. It is possible to use a fume cupboard with natural ventilation and an appropriate air velocity."
25-3.23.5,Samples
25-3.23.5.1,"Shape and dimensions The shape and dimensions of samples are given in Figure 31. The thickness of the sample corresponds to the thickness of the product to be tested. It shall not be more than 13 mm. When sample-taking so permits, the sample shall have a constant section over its entire length. When the shape and dimensions of a product do not permit taking a sample of the given size, the following minimum dimensions shall be observed: (a) For samples having a width of 3 to 60 mm, the length shall be 356 mm. In this case the material is tested over the product's width;  (b) For samples having a width of 60 to 100 mm, the length shall be at least 138 mm. In this case the potential burning distance corresponds to the length of the sample, the measurement starting at the first measuring point; (c) Samples less than 60 mm wide and les than 356 mm long, and samples 60 to 100 mm wide and less than 138 mm long, cannot be tested according to the present method, nor can samples less than 3 mm wide."
25-3.23.5.2,"Sampling At least five samples shall be taken from the material under test. In materials having burning rates differing according to the direction of the material (this being established by preliminary tests) the five (or more) samples shall be taken and be placed in the test apparatus in such a way that the highest burning rate will be measured. When the material is supplied in set widths, a length of at least 500 mm covering the entire width shall be cut. From the piece so cut, the samples shall be taken at not less than 100 mm from the edge of the material and at points equidistant from each other. Samples shall be taken in the same way from finished products when the shape of the product so permits. If the thickness of the product is over 13 mm it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side which does not face the passenger compartment. Composite materials shall be tested as if they were homogeneous. In the case of materials comprising superimposed layers of different composition which are not composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the passenger compartment shall be tested individually."
25-3.23.5.3,"Conditioning The samples shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours, but not more than 7 days, at a temperature of 23 deg. C +/- 2 deg. C and a relative humidity of 50 +/- 5 per cent, and shall be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior to testing. "
25-3.23.6,Procedure
25-3.23.6.1,"Place samples with napped or tufted surfaces on a flat surface, and comb twice against the nap using the comb ( Paragraph-)."
25-3.23.6.2,"So place the sample in the sample holder ( Paragraph-) that the exposed side faces downwards, towards the flame."
25-3.23.6.3,"Adjust the gas flame to a height of 38 mm using the mark in the chamber, the air intake of the burner being closed. The flame shall burn for at least one minute, for stabilization, before the first test is started."
25-3.23.6.4,"Push the sample holder into the combustion chamber so that the end of the sample is exposed to the flame, and after 15 seconds cut off the gas flow."
25-3.23.6.5,Measurement of burning time starts at the moment when the foot of the flame passes the first measuring point. Observe the flame propagation on the side (upper or lower) which burns faster.
25-3.23.6.6,"Measurement of burning time is completed when the flame has come to the last measuring point or when the flame is extinguished before reaching that point. If the flame does not reach the last measuring point, measure the burnt distance up to the point where the flame was extinguished. Burnt distance is the part of the sample destroyed, on the surface or inside, by burning."
25-3.23.6.7,"If the sample does not ignite or does not continue burning after the burner has been extinguished, or the flame goes out before reaching the first measuring point, so that no burning time is measured, note in the test report that the burning rate is 0 mm/min."
25-3.23.6.8,"When running a series of tests or performing repeat tests, make sure before starting a test that the temperature of the combustion chamber and sample holder does not exceed 30 deg. C."
25-3.23.7,"Calculation The burning rate B, in millimetres per minute, is given by the formula:  B = s/t x 60; where: s is the burnt distance, in millimetres, t is the time, in seconds, taken to burn the distance s."
