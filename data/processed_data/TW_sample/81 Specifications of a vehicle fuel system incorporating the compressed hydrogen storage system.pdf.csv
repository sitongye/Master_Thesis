81.6,Test procedures for a vehicle fuel system incorporating the compressed hydrogen storage system 
81.6.1,"Post-crash compressed hydrogen storage system leak test The crash tests used to evaluate post-crash hydrogen leakage are those set out  Paragraph-. of this Regulation. Prior to conducting the crash test, instrumentation is installed in the hydrogen storage system to perform the required pressure and temperature measurements if the standard vehicle does not already have instrumentation with the required accuracy. The storage system is then purged, if necessary, following manufacturer's directions to remove impurities from the container before filling the storage system with compressed hydrogen or helium gas. Since the storage system pressure varies with temperature, the targeted fill pressure is a function of the temperature. The target pressure shall be determined from the following equation: Ptarget = NWP x (273 + To) / 288 where NWP is the Nominal Working Pressure (MPa), To is the ambient temperature to which the storage system is expected to settle, and Ptarget is the targeted fill pressure after the temperature settles. The container is filled to a minimum of 95 per cent of the targeted fill pressure and allowed to settle (stabilize) prior to conducting the crash test. The main stop valve and shut-off valves for hydrogen gas, located in the downstream hydrogen gas piping, are in normal driving condition immediately prior to the impact."
81.6.1.1,"Post-crash leak test: compressed hydrogen storage system filled with compressed hydrogen The hydrogen gas pressure, P0 (MPa) and temperature, T0 (deg. C) are measured immediately before the impact and then at a time interval, delta t (min), after the impact. The time interval, delta t, starts when the vehicle comes to rest after the impact and continues for at least 60 minutes. The time interval, delta t, shall be  increased, if necessary, to accommodate measurement accuracy for a storage system with a large volume operating up to 70MPa; in that case, delta t is calculated from the following equation: delta t = VCHSS x NWP /1,000 x ((-0.027 x NWP +4) x Rs - 0.21) -1.7 x Rs where Rs = Ps / NWP, Ps is the pressure range of the pressure sensor (MPa), NWP is the Nominal Working Pressure (MPa), VCHSS is the volume of the compressed hydrogen storage system (L), and delta t is the time interval (min). If the calculated value of delta t is less than 60 minutes, delta t is set to 60 minutes. The initial mass of hydrogen in the storage system is calculated as follows: Po' = Po x 288 / (273 + T0) rhoo' = -0.0027 x (P0')2 + 0.75 x P0' + 0.5789 Mo = rhoo' x VCHSS The final mass of hydrogen in the storage system, Mf, at the end of the time interval, delta t, is calculated as follows: Pf' = Pf x 288 / (273 + Tf) rhof' = -0.0027 x (Pf')2 + 0.75 x Pf' + 0.5789 Mf = rhof' x VCHSS where Pf is the measured final pressure (MPa) at the end of the time interval, and Tf is the measured final temperature (deg. C). The average hydrogen flow rate over the time interval (that shall be less than the criteria in paragraph 7.2.1.) is therefore VH2 = (Mf-Mo) / delta t x 22.41 / 2.016 x (Ptarget /Po) where VH2 is the average volumetric flow rate (NL/min) over the time interval and the term (Ptarget /Po) is used to compensate for differences between the measured initial pressure, Po, and the targeted fill pressure Ptarget. "
81.6.1.2,"Post-crash leak test: Compressed hydrogen storage system filled with compressed helium The helium gas pressure, P0 (MPa), and temperature T0 (deg. C), are measured immediately before the impact and then at a predetermined time interval after the impact. The time interval, delta t, starts when the vehicle comes to rest after the impact and continues for at least 60 minutes. The time interval, delta t, shall be increased if necessary in order to accommodate measurement accuracy for a storage system with a large volume operating up to 70MPa; in that case, delta t is calculated from the following equation: delta t = VCHSS x NWP /1,000 x ((-0.028 x NWP +5.5) x Rs - 0.3) - 2.6 x Rs where Rs = Ps / NWP, Ps is the pressure range of the pressure sensor (MPa), NWP is the Nominal Working Pressure (MPa), VCHSS is the volume of the compressed storage system (L), and delta t is the time interval (min). If the value of delta t is less than 60 minutes, delta t is set to 60 minutes. The initial mass of helium in the storage system is calculated as follows: Po' = Po x 288 / (273 + T0) rhoo' = -0.0043 x (P0')2 + 1.53 x P0' + 1.49 Mo = rhoo' x VCHSS The final mass of helium in the storage system, Mf, at the end of the time interval, delta t, is calculated as follows: Pf' = Pf x 288 / (273 + Tf) rhof' = -0.0043 x (Pf')2 + 1.53 x Pf' + 1.49 Mf = rhof' x VCHSS where Pf is the measured final pressure (MPa) at the end of the time interval, and Tf is the measured final temperature (deg. C).  The average helium flow rate over the time interval is therefore VHe = (Mf-Mo) / delta t x 22.41 / 4.003 x (Ptarget/ Po) where VHe is the average volumetric flow rate (NL/min) over the time interval and the term Ptarget/ Po is used to compensate for differences between the measured initial pressure (Po) and the targeted fill pressure (Ptarget). Conversion of the average volumetric flow of helium to the average hydrogen flow is calculated with the following expression: VH2 = VHe / 0.75 where VH2 is the corresponding average volumetric flow of hydrogen (that shall be less than the requirements  Paragraph- of this Regulation to comply with)."
81.6.2,"Post-crash concentration test for enclosed spaces The measurements are recorded in the crash test that evaluates potential hydrogen (or helium) leakage ( Paragraph- of this Regulation). Sensors are selected to measure either the build-up of the hydrogen or helium gas or the reduction in oxygen (due to displacement of air by leaking hydrogen/helium). Sensors are calibrated to traceable references to ensure an accuracy of +/-5 per cent at the targeted criteria of 4 per cent hydrogen or 3 per cent helium by volume in air, and a full scale measurement capability of at least 25 per cent above the target criteria. The sensor shall be capable of a 90 per cent response to a full scale change in concentration within 10 seconds. Prior to the crash impact, the sensors are located in the passenger and, luggage compartments of the vehicle as follows: (a) At a distance within 250 mm of the headliner above the driver's seat or near the top centre the passenger  compartment; (b) At a distance within 250 mm of the floor in front of the rear (or rear most) seat in the passenger compartment; (c) At a distance within 100 mm of the top of luggage compartments within the vehicle that are not directly affected by the particular crash impact to be conducted. The sensors are securely mounted on the vehicle structure or seats and protected for the planned crash test from debris, air bag exhaust gas and projectiles. The measurements following the crash are recorded by instruments located within the vehicle or by remote transmission. The vehicle may be located either outdoors in an area protected from the wind and possible solar effects or indoors in a space that is large enough or ventilated to prevent the build-up of hydrogen to more than 10 per cent of the targeted criteria in the passenger and luggage compartments. Post-crash data collection in enclosed spaces commences when the vehicle comes to a rest. Data from the sensors are collected at least every 5 seconds and continue for a period of 60 minutes after the test. A first-order lag (time constant) up to a maximum of 5 seconds may be applied to the measurements to provide ""smoothing"" and filter the effects of spurious data points. The filtered readings from each sensor shall be below the targeted criteria of 4.0 per cent for hydrogen or 3.0 per cent for helium at all times throughout the 60 minutes post-crash test period."
