36.3.1,The same brand
36.3.2,"The same characteristics of the optical system (levels of intensity, light distribution angles, category of light source, light source module, etc.)howeverif light source or filters color is change that it doesnt mean to change the variants."
36.4,Photometric measurements
36.4.1,"In the reference axis, intensity of forward facing parking lamps  Minimum (cd): 2 Maximum (cd): 60"
36.4.2,"In the reference axis, intensity of rearward facing parking lamps Minimum (cd): 2 Maximum (cd): 30 In the case where a device is intended to be installed with its H plane at a mounting height less than 750 mm above the ground, the photometric intensity is verified only up to an angle of 5 degrees downwards."
36.4.3,"In the case of a single lamp containing more than one light source, the lamp shall comply with the minimum intensity required when any one light source has failed and when all light sources are illuminated the maximum intensity shall not be exceeded. All light sources connected in series are considered to be one light source."
36.4.4,"Within the field of light distribution schematically shown as a grid in Figure 1, the light pattern should be substantially uniform."
36.4.5,"Outside the reference axis and within the angular fields, the intensity of the light emitted shall, in each direction corresponding to the points in the luminous intensity distribution reproduced in Figure 1, be not less than the value shown in the said figure for the direction in question, expressed as a percentage of the minimum specified  Paragraph- Paragraph-. In any direction within the space from which the light in question is visible, not exceed the maximum specified  Paragraph- Paragraph-."
36.4.6,A luminous intensity of 60 cd shall be permitted for parking lamps directed to the rear reciprocally incorporated with stop-lamps below a plane forming an angle of 5 with and downward from the horizontal plane.
36.4.7,"Angles required for light distribution in space of the lamps: Horizontal angles are shown in Figure2 and Figure3. In all cases, the minimum vertical angles of light distribution in space are 15 degrees above and 15 degrees below the horizontal except for lamps intended to be installed with their H plane at a mounting height less than 750 mm above the ground, for which they are 15 degrees above and 5 degrees below the horizontal. "
36.4.8,"In the case of light source modules, it shall be checked that:"
36.4.8.1,The design of the light source module(s) shall be such as:
36.4.8.1.1,that each light source module can only be fitted in no other position than the designated and correct one and can only be removed with the use of tool(s);
36.4.8.1.2,"If there are more than one light source module used in the housing for a device, light source modules having different characteristics can not be interchanged within the same lamp housing."
36.4.8.2,The light source module(s) shall be tamperproof.
36.4.8.3,"A light source module shall be so designed that regardless of the use of tool(s), it shall not be mechanically interchangeable with any replaceable approved light source."
36.4.9,"For replaceable light sources: (a) In the case of filament lamp(s), that is necessary to produce the reference luminous flux required for that category of filament lamp. (b) In the case of LED light source(s) of 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V; the luminous flux value produced shall be corrected. The correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied. (c) When equipped with light sources at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, the luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. For filament lamps the correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). For LED light sources the correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5V or 28.0 V).The actual luminous fluxes of each light source used shall not deviate more than +/- 5 per cent from the mean value. Alternatively and in case of filament lamps only, a standard filament lamp may be used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being added together."
36.5,"Trichromatic coordinatepÉThe colour of the light emitted inside the field shall be red, white or orangep·amberp¸defined in  lighting and light- of Directionsp·see Figure 1p¸. Outside this field, no sharp variation of colour shall be observed. However, for lamps equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other), the colorimetric characteristics should be verified with the light sources present in the lamp."
36.6,In the case of replaceable light source(s):
36.6.1,Any category or categories of light source(s) approved according to Filament lamps shall concern about relevant special restriction.
36.6.2,The design of the device shall be such that the light source can be fixed in no other position but the correct one.

36.7,Test procedure
36.7.1,"All measurements, photometric and colorimetric shall be carried out with an uncoloured or coloured standard light source of the category prescribed for the device, supplied with the voltage;"
36.7.1.1,In the case of lamps with non-replaceable light sources: 6.75 V and 13.5 V respectively.
36.7.1.2,"In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear being part of the lamp applying at the input terminals of the lamp the voltage declared by the manufacturer or, if not indicated, 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, respectively."
36.7.1.3,"In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear not being part of the lamp, the voltage declared by the manufacturer shall be applied to the input terminals of the lamp."
36.7.2,The test laboratory shall require from the manufacturer the light source control gear needed to supply the light source and the applicable functions.
36.7.3,The limits of the apparent surface in the direction of the reference axis of a light signalling device shall be determined.  Figure 1.
