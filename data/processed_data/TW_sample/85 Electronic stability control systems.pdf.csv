85.8.11.6,"The Beginning of Steer (BOS) is defined as the first instance when the filtered and zeroed steering wheel angle data reaches -5 degrees (when the initial steering input is anticlockwise) or +5 degrees (when the initial steering input is clockwise) after a time defining the end of the ""zeroing range."" The value for time at the BOS is interpolated."
85.8.11.7,The Completion of Steer (COS) is defined as the time the steering wheel angle returns to zero at the completion of the Sine with Dwell steering manoeuvre. The value for time at the zero degree steering wheel angle is interpolated.
85.8.11.8,The second peak yaw rate is defined as the first local yaw rate peak produced by the reversal of the steering wheel. The yaw rates at 1.000 and 1.750 seconds after COS are determined by interpolation.
85.8.11.9,"Determine lateral velocity by integrating corrected, filtered and zeroed lateral acceleration data. Zero lateral velocity at the BOS point. Determine lateral displacement by integrating zeroed lateral velocity. Zero lateral displacement at the BOS point. The lateral displacement measurement is made at 1.07 seconds after BOS point and is determined by interpolation."

85.9.1,Use of the simulation 
85.9.1.1,The vehicle stability function shall be demonstrated by the vehicle manufacturer to the Type Approval Authority or Technical Service by simulating the dynamic manoeuvres  Paragraph-.
85.9.1.2,"The simulation shall be a means whereby the vehicle stability performance shall be demonstrated with: (a) The yaw rate, one second after completion of the Sine with Dwell steering input (time T0 + 1); (b) The yaw rate, 1.75 seconds after completion of the Sine with Dwell steering input; (c) The lateral displacement of the vehicle centre of gravity with respect to its initial straight path."
85.9.1.3,The simulation shall be carried out with a validated modelling and simulation tool and using the dynamic manoeuvres  Paragraph- under the test conditions  Paragraph-. The method by which the simulation tool is validated is given  Paragraph-.
85.10,Dynamic stability simulation tool and its validation
85.10.1,Specification of the simulation tool
85.10.1.1,"The simulation method shall take into account the main factors which influence the directional and roll motion of the vehicle. A typical model may include the following vehicle parameters in an explicit or implicit form: (a) Axle/wheel; (b) Suspension; (c) Tyre; (d) Chassis/vehicle body; (e) Power train/driveline, if applicable; (f) Brake system; (g) Pay load."
85.10.1.2,The Vehicle Stability Function shall be added to the simulation model by means of:  (a) A subsystem (software model) of the simulation tool; or (b) The electronic control box in a hardware-in-the-loop configuration.
85.10.2,Validation of the simulation tool
85.10.2.1,"The validity of the applied modelling and simulation tool shall be verified by means of comparisons with practical vehicle tests. The tests utilised for the validation shall be the dynamic manoeuvres  Paragraph-. During the tests, the following motion variables, as appropriate, shall be recorded or calculated in accordance with ISO 15037 Part 1:2005: General conditions for passenger cars or Part 2:2002: General conditions for heavy vehicles and buses (depending on the vehicle category): (a) Steering-wheel angle (delta H); (b) Longitudinal velocity (vX); (c) Sideslip angle (beta) or lateral velocity (vY);(optional); (d) Longitudinal acceleration (aX); (optional); (e) Lateral acceleration (aY); (f) Yaw velocity (d psi/dt); (g) Roll velocity (d phi/dt); (h) Pitch velocity (d theta/dt); (i) Roll angle (phi); (j) Pitch angle (theta)."
85.10.2.2,The objective is to show that the simulated vehicle behaviour and operation of the vehicle stability function is comparable with that seen in practical vehicle tests.
85.10.2.3,The simulator shall be deemed to be validated when its output is comparable to the practical test results produced by a given vehicle type during the dynamic manoeuvres  Paragraph-. The relationship of activation and sequence of the vehicle stability function in the simulation and in the practical vehicle test shall be the means of making the comparison. 
85.10.2.4,The physical parameters that are different between the reference vehicle and simulated vehicle configurations shall be modified accordingly in the simulation.
85.10.2.5,"A simulator test report shall be produced, a model and a copy attached to the vehicle approval report."
