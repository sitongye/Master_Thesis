51-2.5.3,Inertial test procedures
51-2.5.3.1,"Option 1, Calculation"
51-2.5.3.1.1,The procedure described in this annex provides a means for analytically determining the ability of a door latch system to withstand inertial loading. Spring forces are the average of the minimum spring output in the installed position and the minimum spring output in the release position. Friction effects and work to be done are not considered in the calculations. Gravitational pull on components may also be omitted if it tends to restrict unlatching. These omissions from the calculations are permissible because they provide additional factors of safety.
51-2.5.3.1.2,Calculation Consideration - Each component or subassembly can be calculated for its minimum inertial load resistance in a particular direction. Their combined resistance to the unlatching operation must assure that the door latch system (when properly assembled in the vehicle door) will remain latched when subjected to an inertial load of 30 g in any direction. Figure 5 is an example of the components and combinations of components to be considered.
