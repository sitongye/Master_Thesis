33.4.3,"In every other direction of measurement shown in Table1 the luminous intensity shall be not less than the minima specified in that Table.

The correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied. (c) When equipped with light source(s) at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, the luminous intensity values produced shall be  corrected. For filament lamps the correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). For LED light sources the correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). The actual luminous fluxes of each filament lamp and/or LED light source used shall not deviate more than 5 per cent from the mean value.Alternatively and in case of filament lamps only, a standard filament lamp may be used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being added together."
33.7.1.2,"In the case of a lamp equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other), at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V respectively."
33.7.1.3,"In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear, being part of the lamp applying at the input terminals of the lamp the voltage declared by the manufacturer or, if not indicated, 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V respectively."
33.7.1.4,In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear not being part of the lamp the voltage declared by the manufacturer shall be applied to the input terminals of the lamp.
33.7.2,The Technical Service shall require from the manufacturer the light source control gear needed to supply the light source and the applicable functions.
33.7.3,"The voltage to be applied to the lamp shall be indicated in the communication form, specified in Annex 1 of this Regulation."
33.7.4,"For any lamp, except those equipped with filament lamps, the luminous intensities measured after one minute and after 10 minutes of operation, shall comply with the minimum and maximum requirements. The luminous intensity distribution after one and after 10 minutes of operation shall be calculated from the luminous intensity distribution measured after photometric stability has occurred by applying at each test point the ratio of luminous intensities measured at HV.  (a) After one minute; (b) After 10 minutes; and (c) After photometric stability has occurred"" Photometric stability has occurred"" means the variation of the luminous intensity for the specified test point is less than 3 per cent within any 15 minute period."
33.7.5,The limits of the apparent surface in the direction of the reference axis of a light-signalling device shall be determined.
33.8,Colour of Light Emitted The colour of the light emitted inside the field of the light distribution grid defined at paragraph 2. of Annex 3 shall be white. For testing see paragraph 4. to this Regulation. Outside this field no sharp variation of colour shall be observed.
