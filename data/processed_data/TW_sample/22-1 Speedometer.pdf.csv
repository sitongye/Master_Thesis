22-1.5,Specifications
22-1.5.1,An onboard speedometer and odometer complying with the requirements of this Regulation shall be fitted to the vehicle to be approved.
22-1.5.2,The display of the speedometer must be located within the direct field of view of the driver and must be clearly legible both day and night. The range of speeds displayed must be sufficiently wide to include the maximum speed of this type of vehicle as stated by the manufacturer. 
22-1.5.3,The numerical values of the speed shall be indicated on the display as follows :
22-1.5.3.1,"In the case of speedometers intended for vehicles of categories M, N, L3, and L5,the graduation shall be 1, 2, 5 or 10 km/h. The numerical values of the speed shall be indicated on the display as follows: when the highest value on the display does not exceed 200 km/h, speed values shall be indicated at intervals not exceeding 20 km/h. When the maximum value on the display exceeds 200 km/h, then the speed values shall be indicated at intervals not exceeding 30 km/h. The indicated numerical speed value intervals need not be uniform."
22-1.5.3.2,"In the case of speedometers intended for vehicles of categories L1 (mopeds) and L2, the display readings must not exceed 80 km/h. The graduation shall be 1, 2, 5 or 10 km/h and the marked numerical values of the speed indicated shall not exceed 10 km/h. The indicated numerical speed value intervals need not be uniform."
22-1.5.4,The accuracy of the speedometer equipment shall be tested in accordance with the following procedure:
22-1.5.4.1,The tyres shall be one of the types normally fitted to the vehicle as defined  Paragraph-. of this Regulation. A test shall be carried out for each type of speedometer intended to be fitted by the manufacturer.
22-1.5.4.2,The test shall be carried out with the vehicle at its unladen weight. An additional weight can be carried for purposes of measurement. The weight of the vehicle and its distribution between the axles shall be indicated in the approval communication;
