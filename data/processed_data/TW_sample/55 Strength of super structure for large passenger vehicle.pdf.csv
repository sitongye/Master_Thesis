55.9.2,"The mathematical model The model shall be capable of describing the real physical behavior of the rollover process, in accordance with Paragraph-. The mathematical model shall be constructed, and assumptions prescribed, in such a way that the calculation gives conservative results. The model shall be built up with the following considerations:"
55.9.2.1,the technical service may require tests to be carried out on the actual vehicle structure to prove the validity of the mathematical model and to verify the assumptions made in the model.
55.9.2.2,the total mass and the centre of gravity position used in the mathematical model shall be identical to those of the vehicle to be approved.
55.9.2.3,the mass distribution in the mathematical model shall correspond to the vehicle to be approved. Moments of inertia used in the mathematical model shall be calculated on the basis of this mass distribution.
55.9.3,"Requirements for the algorithm and simulation program, and for computing equipment "
55.9.3.1,"The position of the vehicle in unstable equilibrium at point of rollover, and the position at first contact with the ground shall be specified. The simulation program may start at the unstable equilibrium position, but shall start, at the latest, at the point of first contact with the ground."
55.9.3.2,The initial conditions at the point of first contact with the ground shall be defined using the change of potential energy from the unstable equilibrium position.
55.9.3.3,"The simulation program shall run, at least, until the maximum deformation is reached."

55.10,Test standard
55.10.1,Roll-over test on a complete vehicle test
55.10.1.1,The superstructure of the vehicle shall have the sufficient strength to ensure that the residual space during and after the rollover test on complete vehicle is unharmed. That means:
55.10.1.1.1,"No part of the vehicle which is outside the residual space at the start of the test (e.g. pillars, safety rings, luggage racks) shall intrude into the residual space during the test. Any structural parts, which are originally in the residual space (e.g. vertical handholds, partitions, kitchenettes, toilets) shall be ignored when evaluating the intrusion into the residual space."
55.10.1.1.2,"No part of the residual space shall project outside the contour of the deformed structure. The contour of the deformed structure shall be determined sequentially, between every adjacent window and/or door pillar. Between two deformed pillars the contour shall be a theoretical surface, determined by straight lines, connecting the inside contour points of the pillars which were the same height above the floor level before the rollover test (see Figure 1)."
55.10.1.2,"Residual space The envelope of the vehicle's residual space is defined by creating a vertical transverse plane within the vehicle  which has the periphery described in Figures 2(a) and 2(c), and moving this plane through the length of the vehicle (see Figure 2(b)) in the following manner:"
55.10.1.2.1,"The SR point is located on the seat-back of each outer forward or rearward facing seat (or assumed seat position), 500 mm above the floor under the seat, 150 mm from the inside surface of the side wall. No account shall be taken of wheel arches and other variations of the floor height. These dimensions shall also be applied in the case of inward facing seats in their centre planes."
55.10.1.2.2,"If the two sides of the vehicle are not symmetrical in respect of floor arrangement and, therefore, the height of the SR points are different, the step between the two floor lines of the residual space shall be taken as the longitudinal vertical centre plane of the vehicle (see Figure 2(c));"
55.10.1.2.3,"The rearmost position of the residual space is a vertical plane 200 mm behind the SR point of the rearmost outer seat, or the inner face of the rear wall of the vehicle if this is less than 200 mm behind that SR point. The foremost position of the residual space is a vertical plane 600 mm in front of the SR point of the foremost seat (whether passenger, crew, or driver) in the vehicle set at its fully forward adjustment. If the rearmost and foremost seats on the two sides of the vehicle are not in the same transverse planes, the length of the residual space on each side will be different;"
55.10.1.2.4,"The residual space is continuous in the passenger, crew and driver compartment(s) between its rearmost and foremost plane and is defined by moving the defined vertical transverse plane through the length of the vehicle along straight lines through the SR points on both sides of the vehicle. Behind the rearmost and in front of the foremost seat's SR point the straight lines are horizontal."
55.10.1.2.5,"The manufacturer may define a bigger residual space than is required for a given seat arrangement, to simulate a worst case in a group of vehicle types to allow for future design development."
55.10.2,Rollover test using body sections as an equivalent approval method
55.10.2.1,The vehicle type shall be approved if all the body sections pass the rollover test and equations are fulfilled.
55.10.2.2,"If one of the body sections fails the test, the vehicle type shall not be approved."
55.10.2.3,"If a body section passes the rollover test, each of the bays which form that body section are considered to have passed the rollover test, and the result can be quoted used in future applications for approval, provided that the ratio of their masses remains the same in the subsequent superstructure."
55.10.2.4,"If a body section fails the rollover test, all the bays within that body section shall be considered to have failed the test even if the residual space is invaded in only one of the bays."
55.10.3,Quais-static loading test of body sections as an equivalent approval method
55.10.3.1,From the plotted load-deformation curve the actual energy absorbed by the body section (EBS) shall be expressed  as the area below the curve (see Figure 9).
55.10.3.2,The minimum energy required to be absorbed by the body section (Emin) shall be determined as follows:
55.10.3.2.1,"the total energy (ET) to be absorbed by the superstructure is: where: M = Mk, unladen kerb mass of the vehicle if there are no occupant restraints; or, Mt, total effective vehicle mass when occupant restraints are fitted, g = gravitational constant, delta h = the vertical movement (in metres) of the vehicle centre of gravity during a rollover test, as determined in appendix 1 to this annex."
55.10.3.2.2,"the total energy ""ET"" shall be distributed among the bays of the superstructure in the proportions of their masses: where: Ei = the absorbed energy by the ""ith"" bay mI = mass of the ""ith"" bay, as determined in annex 4, paragraph 4.1"
55.10.3.2.3,the minimum energy required to be absorbed by the body section (Emin) is the sum of the energy of the bays comprising the body section:
55.10.3.3,"The body section passes the loading test, if: EBS> Emin In this case, all the bays which form that body section are considered to have passed the quasi-static loading test  and these results can be quoted in future requests for approval provided that the component bays are not expected to carry a greater mass in the subsequent superstructure."
55.10.3.4,The body section fails the loading test if: EBS < Emin In this case all the bays which form that body section are considered to have failed the test even if the residual space is invaded in only one of the bays.
55.10.3.5,The vehicle type shall be approved if all the required body sections pass the loading test.
55.10.4,Quasi-static calculation based on testing of components as an equivalent approval method
55.10.4.1,"The total energy (ET) to be absorbed by the superstructure shall be determined as follows: where: M = Mk the unladen kerb mass of the vehicle, if there are no restraints, or Mt the total effective vehicle mass when occupant restraints are fitted G = the gravitational constant delta h = the vertical movement (in metres) of the vehicle centre of gravity during a rollover test, as determined  Paragraph-."
55.10.4.2,The absorbed energy (Ea) of the superstructure is calculated at the incremental load step at which the residual space is first touched by any of the rigid structural parts.
55.10.4.3,The vehicle type shall be approved if Ea > ET
55.10.5,Computer simulation of rollover test on complete vehicle as an equivalent approval method
55.10.5.1,"When the stated requirements for the simulation program are met, the simulation of the changes in geometry of the interior structure and comparison with the geometrical shape of the residual space can be evaluated as defined in the Paragraph-of this Regulation."
55.10.5.2,"If the residual space is not infringed during the rollover simulation, the approval shall be granted."
55.10.5.3,"If the residual space is infringed during the rollover simulation, the approval shall be refused.
