In each position a measurement shall be made. However, no measurement shall be made when: (a) The centreline of the receiver coincides with the filament axis; or (b) The line of sight between the receiver and the filament is blocked by opaque (nontransmitting) parts of the light source, such as lead wires or a second filament, if any."
29.5.10.6.3.2,"` For filament light sources used in headlamps, measurements shall be made in directions around the filament light source with the centreline of the receiver aperture located within an angle +/-30 deg., from the plane perpendicular to the filament light source axis with the origin in the centre of the filament. In case of filament light sources with two filaments, the centre of the driving beam filament shall be taken."
29.5.10.6.3.3,"For filament light sources used in light signalling devices, measurements shall be made in directions around the filament light source with exception of: (a) The area claimed or covered by the cap of the filament light source; and (b) The immediate transition area along the cap. In case of filament light sources with two filaments, the centre of the major filament shall be taken. In case of filament light source categories with a defined distortion-free angle, the measurement shall be done only within the defined angle.
